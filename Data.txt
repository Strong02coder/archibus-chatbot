    "Usage Notes\nBe aware of the following issues:\nWorkplace\nSee Workplace Usage Notes.\nSaaS\u00a0Deployments\nSee SaaS Deployment Usage Notes.\nOnSite\nSee OnSite Usage Notes.\nOnline Help\nTOC and Search Difficulties. Refresh Required. The online help systems are continually updated with late-\nbreaking additions, clarifications, and fixes. After we upload a new version of the help systems, you might have\ntrouble drilling down into the Table of Contents or accessing topics from the search results. You might also notice\nthat the TOC does not expand to display the entry for a topic that you accessed through linking or searching.\nRefreshing the browser, opening the help in a new browser, or deleting the browser's cached information\nresolves this issue.\nMobile Framework\nLocation Services. Android. On Android, the Mobile Location Services work only when you are connected to a\nsecured (https) Archibus domain. This is due to the facts that the Android Mobile client uses a WebView based\non the Chromium browser engine and relies on the Chromium browser location services to obtain the location of\nthe device, and the Chromium browser requires that the domain is secure in order to provide the Location\nservice. (MOB-370)\nSmart Client\nDrawing List. Document Management for Drawings. The Drawing List is sluggish for large (thousands) of\nrecord drawing lists. Most large teams prefer to use Virtual Private Archibus to divide the drawing list by area of\nresponsibility.\nSSO. The Smart Client has a benign error occurring due to searching for a file that is not included in the Web\nCentral deployment (ab-ov-dropdown.axvw). In SSO environments, the error prevents use of several critical\ncommands, such as Edit Data. As a work-around, place a dummy ab-ov-dropdown.axvw file in the deployment.\n(AD-10747)\nWeb Central\nSelect Fields. Localized. If you are running Web Central and edit the standard translation of a field heading to\nuse an apostrophe character, you will find that the Select Fields dialog presents the apostrophe as \"l&apso\". The\nstandard translation provided by Archibus contains a right single quotation mark character instead of the\napostrophe character and the single quotation character displays without issues. (AD-13097)\nFonts are Difficult to Read. Each version of Windows handles fonts slightly differently. If text looks odd and is\ndifficult to read, do the following:\n1. Go to Control Panel / All Control Panel Items / Performance Information and Tools\n2. Click \"Adjust Visual Effects.\"\n3. The \"Performance Options\" dialog appears. Ensure that the \"Smooth edges of screen fonts\" check box is\nchecked.\n(In Chrome browsers, after applying the setting, you may need to clear cache, close, and reopen the browser in\norder for the changes to take effect. In Firefox, the changes are applied immediately.) (WC-2793)\nData Transfer. Excel. When exporting decimal data to Excel under the situation that the Web Central user is in\none locale and Excel is set to a different locale (i.e. when the decimal separator in one is a comma and in the\nother is a decimal point), you should review the rounding of the decimal data in the Excel file to verify that it is\nappropriate for your use. (3035375)\nSmart Search console. Number Column. Non-English. For views that have a Smart Search console in the\ngrid, the Number column does not always display when working with non-English locales. (AD-1728)\nGoogle Maps. When opening a Web Central view configured to consume Google Maps data, (for example, the\nTechnologies / GIS /\u00a0Standard Leaflet Map View / Simple Map - Google ab-leaflet-google-map.axvw), you may\nencounter the error message: \"This page can't load Google Maps correctly.\" Google made some changes\neffective June 11, 2018, such that all Google Map API calls now require a Google Maps API key. Some changes\nwill be necessary for clients who have implemented Google basemaps within the Standard Leaflet map control.\nAny Web Central views that use the Stand Leaflet map control Google basemaps option will require the\n\nfollowing change to the Google Maps API reference in the corresponding view AXVW: <js\nurl=\"//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY\" />, where YOUR_API_KEY is your\nGoogle Maps API key. (WC-3008)\nPolish characters in V.25.x and later user interface. With the V.25.1 user interface refresh, special characters\nin UI titles translated to Polish do not appear like the other characters. For customers who have this issue, we\nrecommend modifying all CSS files in the \\schema\\ab-core\\views\\navigator folder to replace this line: font-\nfamily: \"Open Sans\";\nwith this line: font-family: \"Open Sans\", Arial; (AD-2292)\nHTML Drawing Control\nMultiple Open Drawings. Visible Published Layers. If you open multiple drawings and these drawings\ndo not have the same set of published layers, the drawings will show only the published layers that are\ncommon to all open drawings. (WC-2865)\nDrawings Published in Metric Units. Markers placed together to form a cluster cannot be viewed\nseparately when zoomed in; they will always show as a cluster. (WC-2448)\nReports\nCustom Colors. Add-in managers cannot configure custom colors for report totals. (WC-2046).\nMicrosoft Edge\u00a0\nOn Microsoft Edge, clicking the browser's Back button brings you to the previous site you visited before\nArchibus, not the previous view inside Archibus. This is not an issue if the user is not assigned a home\npage. (AD-1643)\nMS Surface\nLaptops with Touch Screens. Certain events on certain specialized forms (for example, dragging a\nreservation) work with the touch pad and with the mouse, but do not work with the touch screen on MS\nSurface Laptops. The behavior of the events differ between browsers (e.g. between Edge and Chrome).\n(AD-97, APP-3310, APP-3312, WC-2494)\nScroll by Swiping. MS-Surface Pro Windows 10 with Touch Screen. Under both Edge and Chrome,\nyou cannot scroll grid views vertically and horizontally by swiping. The workaround is to disable the\ncustom scroller. To do so: modify WEB-INF/config/context/controls/view/controls-view.xml by setting:\n<property name=\"useScroller\" value=\"false\"/> and restarting the application server. (WC-\n2493)\nChrome\nUser Profile. If Chrome crashes or exhibits odd behavior, your Chrome user profile may be corrupted.\nSee these instructions on how to reset your Chrome user profile:\nhttps://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142059\nFirefox\nHierarchical Tree Drill-downs. On Firefox, collapsing and expanding a tree control panel causes the\ntree control to be rebuilt, which undoes the user's selection of tree nodes. (3036779)\nSybase\nHierarchical Tree Drill-downs. On Sybase, hierarchical trees in views like \"View and Edit Organizational\nUnits\" or \"Map Sites to Organizational Units\" do not display all the hierarchical levels if the tables have\npattern values that are larger than 126 characters. For example, in the above views, the tree uses a\nSELECT LIKE clause for org.hierarchy_ids, which on Sybase is limited to 126 characters. Thus, if\nusing values for Organization Code, the hierarchical tree for organizational units will display only the first\nfour levels because some values in org.hierarchy_ids are larger than 126 characters. This issue\naffects Sybase projects only. (WC-2406)\nConnection Limit. While using Web Central with Sybase Web Edition database engine, you might\nreceive an error in the WEB-INF/archibus.log file stating that the database server connection limit was\nexceeded. The error message reads: java.sql.SQLException: [Sybase][JDBC Driver][SQL\nAnywhere]Database server connection limit exceeded at\nsybase.jdbc.sqlanywhere.IDriver.makeODBCConnection.\nTo fix this issue you need to tweak the value of maxActive in the \\Archibus\\WEB-\nINF\\config\\context\\compatibility\\afm-config.xml file. To do so:\n1. In the afm-config.xml file, search for \"Sybase-WebEdition\" to find the attribute.\n2. Reduce the value for maxActive. The right value might be any value less than 10, except 0. The\nbelow example shows a value of 4.\ntype=\"Sybase-WebEdition\"\n<connectionPool\nmaxActive=\"4\"(3043397)\n\nArchibus V.2024.04\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Eptura, Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

    "Getting Started with Archibus\nSample Data\nArchibus includes the HQ sample project with data and floor plans that are based on actual buildings and\norganizations. The HQ sample project contains several floor plans, as well as comprehensive tables of sample\nstandards, employees, craftspersons, equipment, maintenance procedures, and so on. Signing in as a sample user\nand exploring the Archibus features using the sample data will help you understand how the Archibus applications\naddress specific facilities management goals.\nFor example, if you are curious as to how Archibus handles building efficiency rates, you can load the \u201cBuilding\nPerformance\u201d report and examine how it calculates and presents rentable and usable area data for the sample HQ\nproject. Similarly, if you want to understand a space inventory that tracks vertical penetration and service areas,\nexamine drawing HQ19 (the floor plan of the nineteenth floor of the sample Headquarters building).\nWhile exploring Archibus using the sample HQ project, you can practice with Archibus features by editing the sample\ndata and adding your own records to the sample data.\nTo access the HQ sample project, you sign in as a sample user.

This change was made in V2022.04 online help, but is repeated here for your reference. We no longer support creating\nnew views that integrate with Adobe PDF LiveCycle, and references to this integration feature have been removed from the System Management Help. If you\nrequire the LiveCycle integration topics, you can access them in Archibus V2022.03 online help at\nhttps://help.archibus.com/system_v2022.03/sysman.htm#wc_views/Adv_Views_Techniques/pdf_forms/PDF_forms_introduction.htm. Note that existing views\nthat use this functionality, such as Sustainability & Risk / Health & Safety / Management Reports / Incidents Log, still work and their documentation has not\nchanged. We will assess integration with Adobe Experience Manager Forms (the Adobe offering that replaces Adobe PDF\u00a0LiveCycle) based on customer\nfeedback in our UserVoice forum. (DOC-2730)\nWorkplace. Group Moves. In a previous Archibus release, we removed the ability for a department manager to request group moves from Workplace; we have\nnow updated the documentation to reflect this change.(AD-10816)\nCompatibility Matrix. Previously, this was available on Allbound. You can now find it in the System Management Help at\nhttps://help.archibus.com/system/sysman.htm#matrix1/WebCentral.htm and https://help.archibus.com/system/sysman.htm#matrix1/ClientServer.htm\nChanges in Web Central\nBIM\u00a0Viewer\nNon-English Versions of Revit. The BIM\u00a0Viewer is no longer limited to working with models saved on English version of Revit. (AD-11279)\nPerformance. Upgraded to Autodesk Platform Services Viewer v7.81.0. This provides faster rendering of models. (AD-12463)\nUX Improvements. The \"Work for Assets\" tab has been renamed to \"Work Requests.\" The Equipment Details pane now displays as a pop-up; previously,\nthe Equipment Details overlapped the system explorer console. (AD-11547, AD-10953)\n\nEquipment Diagnostics. When viewing diagnostics for an equipment item, you can now see diagnostics for 30, 60, 90 days or a custom period you\ndefine. (AD-11084)\nAssets Tab. New Query. When the Assets tab is active, there is a new query available:\u00a0Approaching End of Life. (AD-11604)\nEquipment Systems. You can now highlight rooms served by equipment.(AD-10950)\nEquipment Systems. After tracing a system, if you choose to load a floor the application will restrict the system highlightis to the selected floor.\nRoom Labels. Room labels now hide empty values.\nLevels. A problem with the model not showing levels under some circumstances has been corrected. (AD-11999)\nPublishing. We implemented new logic in the BIM Viewer that, for publishing, extracts the system data from the model at runtime .The previous process\nrelied on publishing the system data from the model at the time of publishing from Revit, which was causing some data to not be displayed.. (AD-12079)\nSigning Back in After a Time-Out. If your session expires and you sign back in, when you click anything on the Navigator, you no longer receive an error\nmessage. The workaround to refresh the browser page is not required. (AD-10570, AD-10602)\nImages. Firefox. When images have a larger vertical size than horizontal size (a portrait image), they no longer appear distorted on Firefox. This was not an\nissue for other Web browsers. (AD-7140)\nMetrics. Previously, if there were no records for calculating a metric value (for example: no completed work requests for problem type ELECTRICAL), then no\nrecords would be created. Now, if there are no records for calculating a metric value (for example: no completed work requests for problem type ELECTRICAL),\nthen records are created but with metric value = zero. (ex. problem_type = ELECTRICAL, metric_value = 0); This change removes the disconnect\nbetween the metric value for the \"All\" granularity which can be <> 0 and drill-downs by other granularities. (AD-2022, AD-12244)\nPrint QR\u00a0Labels. Previously, if Load Balancer or Reverse Proxy was in place, then the getBaseURL() function returned an HTTP URL in HTTPS environments\n. This resulted in problems with the \"Print QR Labels\" feature. This has been corrected. (AD-2520)\nChanges in OnSite Mobile App\nConnect for Archibus Maintenance. We are no longer offering this deployment option, which was a connection tool for linking OnSite with a non-SaaS\nenvironment. The documentation for this deployment option has been removed. (ON-1999)\nAndroid. Editing Comments. If you use Settings/Display to set enlarged text and enlarged fonts, the edit icon (three dots) for comments now correctly displays.\n(ON-1528)\nVPA. Reference Documents. There is no longer inconsistent behavior between OnSite and the Maintenance Console concerning reference documents and\nVPA. Previously, when there were reference documents that matched the VPA setting, OnSite listed the documents, whereas the Maintenance Console hides the\nReferences tab and does not list the documents. (ON-1491)\nBottom Navigation Bar. The footer now includes a bottom navigation bar so that you can easily return to the home hub. (ON-1596)\nChanges in Workplace\nRoom Name. In order to comply with accessibility standards, conference rooms in Workplace no longer display their room names. This change was made\nseveral releases ago, but had not been documented. (DOC-2982)\nEmployee Move Request. When you create an employee move request from Workplace and then view the request in Web Central (View Service Request\ntask), you will no longer find that there is incorrect or missing data. (AD-10440)\nBuilding Name. You can now control whether or not the Building Name appears in Workplace by setting the\nAbSpaceHotelling.ShowBuildingonWorkspaceCard and the AbWorkplaceReservations.ShowBulldingonMeetingCard application parameters.\n(AD-10614)\nAccessibility. We have made several minor UI\u00a0changes to support WAGS accessibility. (AD-11690).\nNotifications. All service request notifications now include a link to Workplace Request Details page. Previously, the links went to the View Service Requests\nview in Web Central (ab-helpdesk-request-view-tabs.axvw). (AD-11023)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nSearching. Dismiss Keyboard. If you search and then dismiss the keyboard, the screen area that the keyboard occupied no longer remains blank. (AD-8227, AD-\n8006)\nBlank Areas. We have resolved problems of extra blank areas appearing in various screens of the Workplace mobile app. (AD-8258).\nHeader and Footer. On iPhone 12, the header of the application is no longer cut; you can now access buttons located at the top of the screen, such as \"My\nAccount\" or \"Cancel\" buttons. (AD-7459)\nIcon and Title. On iPhones and iPads, the main page listing all your apps no longer has the wrong icon and title for the Workplace app. (AD-8653)\nMeeting Reservation. You can now change Start Time or Duration from the selected value to none; you are no longer limited to changing only to other available\nStart Times or Durations. (AD-9554)\nAndroid. Landscape Mode. You can now work with Workplace in landscape mode on android mobiles without encountering UI issues. (AD-9574)\nAndroid Tablets. Cancel Button. On the list of reservations you made, the button to cancel an entire series now displays for booked meetings. (AD-11633)\nAndroid. Signing In. When using a URL that previously connected, you will no longer have trouble connecting on an Android. (AD-11743)\nAndroid. Comment Field. On the Service Request detail page (type Maintenance), when you tapped inside the comment text box, the keyboard would hide the\ncomment field so that you could not see what you were typing. This has been corrected and the page scrolls automatically so the keyboard displays below the\ncomment box. (AD-10535)\nWorkplace Desk Bookings (hotelable rooms)\nCanceling. On the Workspace Booking details page, the Cancel button is now hidden for those users whose security group does not permit cancellation. (AD-\n11734)\nVisitor Booking Canceled in Error. If a visitor booked a room for a date, you made a recurring booking for the same date, you made a second recurring\nbooking for these dates, you canceled the duplicate booking when prompted, the visitor booking would also be deleted. This has been corrected. (AD-11890)\nCalendar. The count at the top of the calendar column now correctly indicates the number of team members with booking on that particular day; previously, it\nalso included bookings made for other employees who are not team members. (AD-11665)\nRooms without Room Categories. The following has been resolved: the Create and Review Bookings view may show fewer rooms available for a building than\na user might expect IF rooms have been flagged as bookable but do not have a Room Category associated with them. Since hotelable rooms should be in\noccupiable space, and since Room Categories are required to indicate occupiable space, those users who are defining hotelable rooms will want to check that all\nrooms defined as hotelable include a Room Category value. In a future release the Define Hotelable Rooms view might be updated to enforce that requirement.\n(AD-4915)\nAccessibility. Colors. We have updated the colors on the Calendar. (AD-11518)\nWorkplace Meeting Room Reservations\nSetup and Cleanup Periods. Previously, if you set the Pre-Block and Post-Block booking times as part of a meeting room arrangement, Workplace did not\nreflect these times. (AD-11158)\nFloors with No Available Meeting Rooms. On the Meeting Space Booking screen, previously the floor selector did not include floors that did not have rooms\navailable for reserving. We received feedback that this was confusing; now, these floors are available from the floor selector. This change enables users to view\nthe floor plans, even though they will not be able to reserve rooms on these floors. (AD-11800)\nChanges in Smart Client, Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD and Revit\n\nSmart Client Extension for Revit\nThe following problems were fixed:\nCatalog: On high DPI monitors, the catalog form did not display properly. (AD-11610)\nPublish 2D: JSON (asset files) not created if multiple levels were cataloged in the same session. (AD-5917)\nPublish 2D: Room labels not created in the same location as in the Revit model. (AD-10752)\nPublish 2D: Some published rooms did not have the correct shape. (AD-11261)\nPublish 2D: Occasionally some rooms were not published. (AD-11264)\nPublish 2D: Published circular areas were not always selectable in the Web Central Space Plan Viewer. (AD-12170)\nThe following improvements were made:\nClear/Remove Data: Is now more efficient. (AD-10760)\nPublish 3D (Forge): Now creates SVF2 files for improved performance in the BIM Viewer. (AD-12015)\nSmart Client\nDrawing Management: Corrected a problem with status icons not always displayed correctly. (AD-11195)\nLocale. If you changed the locale you would experience errors when loading the Navigator's Drawings tab. This has been corrected.

(AD-7802)\nChanges in Space\nMove Console. Automatic Look-up. Automatic look-ups no longer cause issues in the Move Console. (AD-11796)\nSpace Console. Floor Plans. PDF Export. A problem with floor plans not being centered when exported has been resolved. Also, a problem with the drawing\nnot correctly displaying if zoomed has been resolved. (AD-9817, AD-10753)\nSpace Console. Highlighting by Promoted Field. Previously, if you promoted a field (such as the Recovery Status field in the Define Locations view),\nhighlighted by this field in the Space Console, and then opened the Legend panel; you would receive an error. This has been resolved. (AD-11598)\nSpace Console. Teams. Previously, you might have encountered errors when using the \u201cShow Teams\u201d option. Also, the Team legend contained duplicate\nrecords in the PDF export. These have been corrected. (AD-12027, AD-11729)\nSpace Console. Bulk Update. Under some circumstances, bulk assigning room attributes would update only the first room. This has been corrected. (AD-11051)\n\nSpace Console. Validated Room Type Field. Previously, you could enter in the Room Type field a value that did not exist in the validating Room Types table.\nThis has been resolved. (AD-11948)\nSpace Console. SQL Injection issues. Several SQL Injection issues were addressed in the Space Console to fix vulnerabilities toward Fed RAMP goals. This\nis particularly important for Enterprise customers.\nAD-11966:Modify the unit test variables inside spread sheet files of selenium test.\nAD-11868: Fix SQL Injection issues in Space Console - process verbatim sql parameters for Define Teams view.\nAD-11867: Fix SQL Injection issues in Space Console - convert verbatim type sql parameter \u2018restrictToFloor\u2019 to normal restriction.\nAD-10971: Fix SQL Injection issues in Space Console - process verbatim sql parameters for Categories/Organization/Room Standard sub tabs.\nAD-10969: Fix SQL Injection issues in Space Console - process verbatim sql parameters for View Selected Rooms/Employees/Teams pop-up\nAD-10966: Fix SQL Injection issues in Space Console - process verbatim sql parameters for Team sub tab and Define Teams view.\nAD-10932: Fix SQL Injection issues in Space Console - Replace Common parameters with sql restrictions.\nChanges in Real Property\nDeleting Leases. Lease Administrators, assigned to security group RPLM-LEASE-DELETE, can now delete leases from the Lease Portfolio Console's Select\nLease tab. (AD-7648)\nDeleting Suites. In the Lease Portfolio Console, Lease Administrators can now delete available suites that have not yet been assigned directly from the\"\nAvailable Suites - Not Yet Assigned\" tab. Previously, this action presented an error message. (AD-11367)\nChanges in Maintenance\nMaintenance Console. Grouping. You can now group requests by Priority. (AD-7781).\nMaintenance Console. Japanese. Under a Japanese environment, the Maintenance Console's Comments are no longer shifted to the right; they now properly\nalign. (AD-10497)\nMaintenance Console. Equipment Documents. Only the Add, Update, and Delete actions for working with documents are now controlled by the user role.\nPreviously, additional actions such as Show and Download were incorrectly controlled by user role. (AD-8299)\nMaintenance Console. Exports. XLS and DOC Exports were not working with Quick Filters. This has been fixed. (AD-11619)\nMaintenance Console. Locate button. A problem with Work Request Location form not loading when you press the Locate button has been resolved. (AD-12393)\nEmail. A problem with duplicate emails being sent for status change has been resolved. (AD-6615)\nSearch and Manage Work Requests. Archived work requests now include resources; previously, the view was not showing them. (AD-8272, AD-12172)\nPM. Work Order Generation. When the routine to generate PM\u00a0work requests generates a work request that has an ID that is a multiple of 1000, (such as 2000,\n3000, 10,000, and so on), the work request generation routine would fail. This has been corrected. (AD-12151)\nChanges in Workplace Services\nHoteling\nWorkplace Utilization Report. Chart. The Workplace Utilization report (ab-rr-ht-rpt-booking.axvw) now includes a double-column chart that displays both the\nselected floor Reservations count and the Bookings count as two separate (colored differently) columns for each date in the date range filter. (AD-7382)\nReservations\nAuthentication. In response to Microsoft disabling Basic Authentication for Exchange Online as of October 1, 2022, we have implemented Oauth2\nauthentication for sending emails through Exchange Online.(AD-10171)\nExchange Listener. Emails for Canceled Reservations. The following issue has been resolved: When a user cancels a recurring reservation with room\nconflicts from Exchange, the Exchange listener encounters a NullPointerException when processing an occurrence without room. This causes the processing to\nabort, the database transaction rolls back, and processing of the same cancellation restarts every half hour. As a result, the user can get cancellation\nconfirmation emails every half hour until someone cancels the reservations via Web Central. (AD-11711)\nExchange. Mailbox Auto-discover. Auto-discover failure was cached for up to 24 hours, causing all calendar updates from Web Central to Exchange on that\nmailbox to fail for 24 hours, until the entry indicating the failure (which was temporary) was removed from the cache.. This has been resolved. (AD-12392)\nExchange. SMTP was sending email even though Exchange Online was enabled, resulting in error messages. This has been resolved. (AD-11922)\nReservations Calendar Console. Images. Images inserted in the Layout Document field (using the Define Room Configurations view) were not shown in\nReservations Calendar Console view. This has been corrected. (AD-12417)\nReservations Calendar Console. A problem with rooms not being highlighted on the floor plan if the bl/fl/rm id contains a space (such as room 101 - T) has\nbeen resolved. (AD-11654)\nExpired Reservations. Notifications. Users no longer receive notification email for expired, non-approved reservations. (AD-9930)\nOutlook Plugin. Recurring Reservations. An error when selecting a weekend day as End Date has been resolved. (AD-3592)\nArchibus\u00a0Help known limitations\nNon-English help from the Navigator. If you use the right-click Help command on a Navigator process, you will receive an error message that the topic cannot\nbe found. This is because the localized version of Archibus Help does not contain topics at this level of detail. In a future release, the right-click Help command\nwill load the appropriate topic from the English version of Archibus Help. (AD-2786)\nArchibus SaaS known limitations\nHome Page Publishing. SaaS Partner Administrator. If you sign in as a SaaS Partner Administrator (such as sample user AFM-BP), run the System / SaaS\nPartner Administrator / Manage Home Pages and Processes task, modify a home page, and publish your changes; you receive an error message. As a\nworkaround: use System / Add-In Manager / Publish Home Pages by Role to publish home pages after modifying them. (APP-6426)\nNavigator for AFM-MOD Sample User. If you sign in to the HQ sample project as AFM-MOD, you will notice that the Navigator groups modules into domains\n(including the Archibus SaaS domain) so that the Navigator presents four levels. Having some modules grouped under the Archibus SaaS domain may be\nconfusing if you are demonstrating or learning the product. This change is a result of the Healthcare module being added to the Navigator and the Navigator now\nexceeding 13 modules. This can be resolved by removing a module that you do not need. (AD-12985)\nOnSite mobile app known limitations\nAndroid. Accessing Documents. If you attempt to open a DOCX file linked to a work request on an Android phone, you receive an error message. This is a\nresult of the phone not having an app to open DOCX files. You can install an app for this purpose. (ON-1495)\nNotifications. Chinese. Push notifications are not yet supported for Chinese. (ON-1058)\nNotifications. Oracle. With an Oracle deployment, you cannot receive notification from OnSite; if you check the Web Central Notifications Log view, you will not\nsee any messages sent from OnSite. (ON-1237)\nNew Requests. Cannot See. After you create a new request, you may not see it in the Request List because it is added to the end of the request list. You can\nuse the pull-to-refresh feature to re-sort the requests according to the \u201corder by\u201d option.(ON-487)\nWork Request List. Updating. When you create a new request, it is added to the bottom of the list because the sort order of work requests is not updating to\nreflect a new request. Pulling to refresh solves this issue.(ON-723)\nWorkplace known limitations\n\nRequest Types with Questions. Displaying User Responses. If you make a request in Workplace for a Request Type that has questions and also has a\nProblem Type, the user's responses to the questions do not display in the Workplace Services / Service Desk / Client / View Service Requests task; the\nresponses are correctly recorded as XML in the activity_log.act_quest field. \u00a0Requests for Request Types that do not have a value for Problem Type do\nsuccessfully display the user response. (AD-12927)\nService Catalog. Accessibility Mode. If Accessibility Mode is enabled, the ..archibus/schema/ab-products/essential/workplace/index.html?\naction=servicecatalog URL displays the pre-V2022.02 Service Catalog view and does not display the Dashboard, as is the behavior for V2022.02 and beyond\nwithout Accessibility Mode. (AD-8901)\nMaintenance Requests. Comments. If a work request has a very large file attached, you cannot save a comment that you enter. This happens only for work\nrequests with large file attachments. (AD-11360)\niPad Pro. People & Places. UI. The email address in the right panel is not properly displayed. (AD-9466)\nSafari. iPhone 12 (latest iOS 16.2). SSO environments only. If you start Workplace in a Safari browser and without signing out, you close the web browser\nwindow fully and then reopen the web browser window and attempt to navigate to the Workplace Interface again, you will not be able to start Workplace. To work\naround the issue, clear the browser cache and reopen the browser. Or, open the browser, close the Workplace tab which is stuck, open a new tab and enter a\nWeb Central or Workplace URL. (AD-12878)\nDesk Bookings (Hotelable Rooms)\nBooking Multiple Seats. Floor Capacity Target. When the application is set up such that AbSpaceHotelling-AllowMultipleBookings is set to Yes and\nAbSpaceHotelling-EnforceFloorCapacityTarget is set to Yes, when users encounter a room with more than 1 seat available, they have the option to\nbook multiple seats in their own name. However, users can book up to the total number of available seats in this room, even if it exceeds the Floor Capacity\nTarget set for this floor. They will be able to proceed with the booking and exceed the Floor Capacity Target. The next person who tries to book on the floor,\nhowever, will be prevented from making any further bookings. (AD-7498).\nTeam Restriction. When the \u201cteam\u201d restriction is defined, and the space selected for booking is assigned to a specific team, the occupants selection list should\nbe restricted to that team. Instead, the occupant list is not restricted to the team. (AD-11906)\nMeeting Room Reservations\nSelf-booking. QR\u00a0Codes. When the self-booking a meeting room is not permitted (SelfServiceBookMeetingSpace = 0, KioskBookMeetingSpace =\n0) you will find that after scanning the QR code label, the Book button is displayed. It should be hidden based on the parameter settings. (AD-9683)\nMultiple Room Configurations. In Workplace, we assume that only one configuration and one room arrangement has been defined for a room. If you create\nmultiple room configurations with the Reservations application, the configurations will appear in Workplace, but there is no distinguishing information about the\nconfigurations and the user will not know which space they are reserving. There will also appear to be a discrepancy between the available room count and the\nnumber of rooms shown on the floor plan. (AD-835, APP-5194, APP-5845)\nRecurrence Pattern. Workspace reservations do not show recurrence patterns in the details view. You can only delete a single occurrence at a time. AD-835)\nTime Slots. Meeting space requests do not honor the value of the parameter in AbWorkplaceReservations-MinutesTimeUnit. You can only select time\nintervals in 30-minute blocks. (AD-7010)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nCreate Request. Next Button. Android Tablet Browser. If you run the Workplace mobile app on an Android tablet, you will find that if the selected request type\npresents a questionnaire for you to answer as part of entering the request, Workplace will not display a Next button and you cannot continue with the request.\n(AD-12848)\nQR Codes. The Home button is not available after scanning a QR code, and from QR Code page, it is difficult to navigate to the log-in screen. (AD-9659, AD-9681)\nSigning in. Android. Mobile Client version. You cannot log in if you are not using Mobile Client 4.0. As a workaround, upgrade to Mobile Client 4.0. (AD-6801)\nFloor Selection. Accessibility Mode. The floor selector buttons are replaced with drop-down lists. In both modes, Workplace should use floor selector buttons.\n(AD-9844)\nSelect Occupants for Workspace Booking. If you try to book six or more staff for working space, the UI cannot correctly display you selected employees. (AD-\n8599)\nWeb Central known limitations\nBIM\u00a0Viewer.\nLocalized. In localized versions of Archibus, you will find that the tooltips on the Autodesk Forge toolbar are not localized. (AD-12210)\nUnresponsive Highlights. The highlights in the BIM Viewer become unresponsive after six minutes of working with the same building or six minutes of\ninactivity. This is because the datasource becomes unresponsive. You must reload the view and then set the highlights again. (AD-12120)\nBlank Worksheets. For some Revit 2022 models, the new feature \u201cSheets & Views\u201d may display the worksheets as blank. This is an issue with the\nAutodesk Platform Services API that we could not fix on our side and we are waiting for Autodesk to fix. (AD-10801)\nEquipment Labels. After you load a floor from the Levels drop-down and turn on the Equipment labels, the BIM Viewer displays the labels for all the\nequipment in the building instead of just the labels for the equipment on the floor being visualized. (AD-12488)\nExport to XLS. Restriction. If a restriction is in effect and you use the view's Export to XLS command, when you open the Excel file you will find that the\nrestriction message blocks the exported records and you will not be able to see all the fields. Manually adjust the format of the Excel file to see all the content.\n(DOC- 2749, AD-11606)\nSelect Values. Floors. For view 2.0 views that have a filter that includes the Floor Code field, the view may not show all available floors. The root cause is that\nthe core UI grid control determines the number of pages based on the number of index records. For the Floor selector, the index uses the Building Code, i.e.\nthere are 111 buildings with floors. Thus, the grid shows only two pages of floor records (one page = 100 records). (AD-3706)\nMenu options hidden. When a view title is too long, the top menu actions (User Menu, User Help, Add to Favorites) and client logo are not visible. (AD-4820)\nNavigator. Non-English Locale. If you launch Web Central from the Smart Client and are using a non-English locale, the Web Central Navigator will not display\nyour applications and tasks. (AD-3866)\nPolish characters in V.25.x and later user interface. With the V.25.1 user interface refresh, special characters in UI titles translated to Polish do not appear like\nthe other characters. For customers who have this issue, we recommend modifying all CSS files in the \\schema\\ab-core\\views\\navigator folder to replace this\nline: font-family: \"Open Sans\";\nwith this line: font-family: \"Open Sans\", Arial; (AD-2292)\nQuestionnaires. Non-English. Questionnaires, such as those in Condition Assessment and Sustainability Assessment, do not allow assessors to edit out-of-\nthe-box, sample questions that have been localized from English (US) to other languages. The workaround is for Archibus Administrators to use Archibus Smart\nClient to edit the text of these sample questions. This issue affects only sample data questionnaires that have been localized from English. (AD-1547)\nExtended Questionnaires. Document/Photo. The Web Central questionnaire form (for both Compliance and Maintenance) does not currently support\nrespondent-initiated submission of more than one document/photo attachment per question, whether or not the questionnaire designer specifies a value greater\nthan 1 for Maximum Number Responses. The mobile app does support this feature. You cannot delete the uploaded document after Save the question-answer;\nthere is no action when clicking the X button. A questionnaire designer should take this into account when designing forms. (APP-2426, AD-4431)\nIf the intended respondents will be using Web Central to submit documents and flexibility in number of document responses is desired, then the designer\ncan work around the limitation by defining a parent question containing a follow-up question of type document and allow multiple instances of the parent\nquestion.\nFor example, parent question could be multiple choice \"attach a document?\" Yes/No. If Yes, then the application shows the document question as a\nfollow-up. Set up the \"Attach a document\" question to allow multiple answers, such that the respondent can add another, answer \"Yes\" and so on.\nHome Page Editor. Maps. When creating home pages, you add only one map bucket to each home page. (WC-2790)\nHome Pages. Localized. For some international users, home pages may display English titles for columns in the Metric Trends panel. If this issue occurs, the\nuser can switch to a different home page and go back, or sign out and sign in again. (WC-2373)\n\nGrid. Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) fields. If working with a view in which you define highlight patterns (such as Space / Space Inventory / Background\nData / Define Division and Department Highlight Patterns, ab-sp-create-dp-hatch.axvw), and you set a gradient highlight, create a swatch bitmap, and refresh the\nview, the Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) field will not correctly show the swatch bitmap for the gradient highlight. Instead, the fields show the same color for all\ngradient highlight definitions. (WC-2748)\nGrid 3.0. Grid Control 3.0, which is used in views such as PM Planner (ab-pm-planner.axvw) and Service Console (ab-request-console.axvw), presents an error\nif you try to sort by a field that is not from the main table. (AD-8474)\nSchema Change Wizard. Oracle. When using Schema Change Wizard on an Oracle database, you may face the error ORA-01031: insufficient privileges when\nchoosing to re-create any of the Archibus security tables: afm_users; afm_groups. Resolution: Choose \"Alter existing table structures (preserves additional\nfields)\" option when trying to update afm_users/afm_groups tables. (3045736)\nSmart Client known limitations\nNavigator. With a non-SaaS license, logging in to the Smart Client as AFM incorrectly produces a Navigator that includes an Archibus SaaS process. (AD-3794)\nSAML. Connecting to SAML requires user to make server selection on subsequent sign-ins. (AD-1996)\nCertificate Authentication. Web Central tasks. Cannot data transfer or launch Web Central if Certificate Authentication is in effect. (SMAR-626)\nEditing standards tables. If you edit Furniture Standards or Equipment Standards with the default database, the titles for the Length and Width fields will show\nincorrectly as \"ft\" or \"M\". If you log in with a different locale (e.g. view an Imperial project as a Metric user) the program will convert the values. The condition also\noccurs in Furniture or Equipment Standards views loaded in Web Central. To avoid this condition in both environments, load the Archibus Fields table (afm_flds),\nfind the Length and Width fields, and change their Numeric Format from \"Length\" to \"Default\". (3037311)\nDeleting a record with a date/time field as part of its primary key. You are unable to delete records from tables that have a date/time field as part of the\nprimary key, such as the ehs_medical_mon_results table. There are no such errors when deleting records from the same table in Web Central views. (WC-2169)\nDeleting. hwr and hwo tables. It is not possible to delete records from Smart Client grid views that present these tables. As a work-around, delete the records\nfrom Web Central. (SMAR-596)\nDeleting. Bulk Editing. Currently there is no way of bulk deleting data from Smart Client. If you select all records and then hit Delete, only those records\ncurrently displayed on screen are deleted; all of the other records that are selected but not on screen remain. As a work-around, in View Definition Wizard, create\na single panel interactive report for the table in question, choose only the primary key field(s) unless you need to add a restriction. In the preview pane, enable\nadvanced editing, and add multipleSelectionEnabled=\u201dtrue\u201d in the panel, then insert a panel action with a command type deleteSeletedRows.\nSave Changes and preview the view and you can check all and delete right from the preview, without needing to save/publish it. (SMAR-17)\nRibbon. The Smart Client ribbon is very small on high resolution monitors. (SMAR-503)\nGrid. Refresh when filtering. After you set and clear a filter, the grid does not correctly update record counts and refresh. As a workaround, run the Clear action\non the menu ribbon. (SMAR-609)\nReplace Column. When there are more than two tables in the standard role attached to the Smart Client grid view, the command presents errors. (SMAR-528)\nModified views cannot be saved as default view. Log in as a user that has the Security group SYS-VIEW-ALTER (such as AFMX), open a view, change the\nview, save, and make it the default view. Reload, and the default view will not reflect your changes. (SMAR-329)\nExplorer pane. Recent Views list. When you create new views and save them in the Explorer's list of recent views, you can save up to 8 views. When you save\nthe ninth view, the system removes the newest view from the list. It should remove the oldest view from the list. (SMAR-907)\nData Transfer. Dates deleted from the output file are not cleared in the database after transferring in the file with the changes made. (SMAR-671)\nSmart Client Extension for AutoCAD\u00a0known limitations\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nInsert Asset. The Insert Asset logic doesn\u2019t take into account the AssetTypeDetail.ParameterUnits value when inserting the asset. Therefore, in a\ndrawing with Imperial/Architectural units, running the Insert Asset command on the RM layer inserts the asset in inches rather than feet. (AD-7470)\nQuery Table. The Query Table command does not include fields that contribute to the primary key; for example, it does not show the Building Code and Floor\nCode values for rooms. (SMAR- 798)\nHighlighting commands\nUnclosed polylines. If some areas don't highlight with solid highlights, they might be open not closed polylines. If so, close them. The AutoCAD solids\ndon't fill unclosed-closed polylines. AutoCAD hatch patterns do, however. Notice that if you have multiple areas of one type (e.g. Office standard), having\none unclosed polyline may cause others to also not have a solid fill (since Archibus hatches many of them in one go for efficiency's sake). (3030818)\nHatch patterns. The Archibus-defined patterns (from the .pat file) are not being loaded into AutoCAD at the time of highlighting. Only the out-of-the-box\nAutoCAD patterns work as expected because the highlighting logic defaults to a SOLID hatch pattern if it can't find the pattern definition. (SMAR-902)\nLarge floor plans. When dealing with very large floor plans (3,500 rooms on a single floor), commands like Catalog Layer and Highlight by Department do not\ngive progress feedback, but function correctly.\nAsset Text Height. The Smart Client Extension ignores the atxt_ht_in and atxt_ht_cm in favor of the atxt_ht value, which is in inches. For metric drawings the\nSCE converts this to cm. (SMAR-189)\nEdit Data. Suite areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0.\nIf you press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nTrial layers. Asset text. Asset text is left-justified instead of center-justified. (SMAR-492)\nExplorer window. Anchoring. When you open a drawing from within the Smart Client drawings list, the Explorer window should be positioned according to the\nsettings made in the previous session; instead, it opens in the floating position and you must reset it.(SMAR-702)\nDrawing Publishing\u00a0\nAutoCAD Leader objects. EMF does not support arrows or text with the leaders. SVG supports only solid arrows. (3044919)\nSecondary circulation areas as regions. As documented in\nhttps://www.archibus.net/ai/abizfiles/v23_help/archibus_help/user_en/archibus.htm#../Subsystems/webc/Content/web_user/space/concepts/open_plan.htm,\nyou can draw accurate polylines for secondary circulation using AutoCAD REGIONS. Publishing these drawings may result in rooms being set incorrectly\nin front of or behind other rooms. In order for rooms within a secondary circulation region to be shown and highlighted in front of the secondary circulation\nspace in a published drawing, they must be numbered higher than the secondary circulation space. (3051186)\nXREF The XREF Layer does not publish when the TURNOFFALL* value is specified in the additional layers field. As a workaround, turn off layers\nindividually and do not use the TURNOFFALL* feature to control XREF Layers.(SMAR-1001)\nAFM_NET_LISP \"Publish\" command. Ignores the viewWindow attribute when the publishType is EMF and the generated file is published to extents.\n(SMAR-737).\nSVG. Background Color. If you set the Set the ColorMapping field to BLACK for AbPubBackground in the sample HQ database and publish, the black\nbackground does not appear to take effect. This is because there are multiple active rules in the database, and later results overwrite the earlier ones. To\nresolve this either (a) set the Active flag to No for all of the SVG files except for one; or, (b) specify a unique Rule Suffix (e.g. -bl, -reg, -eq) for each rule,\nexcept for the one that has a Color Mapping value so that different rules will produce different output files. (SMAR-417)\nSVG. Hatches. Complex hatches, meaning that there are multiple polylines that are used as the boundaries for the hatch, do not publish to SVG; whereas\nhatches that do successfully publish are contained in a single polyline. You can separate the hatches using HATCHEDIT, and the publishing will work as\nexpected. (SMAR-513)\nRefreshing. Firefox. If your workstation uses Firefox and you load a drawing's enterprise graphics in Web Central or in the Smart Client, then republish\nthat drawing's enterprise graphics, the change may not appear when you reload the view with the enterprise graphics. For performance reasons, some\nversions of Firefox do not immediately refresh the enterprise graphics files from their local cache even when the file has a later time stamp, as checking\nthe time stamp involves an extra query to the server for each file. To view your changes, clear your cache or restart your browser. If you wish to see\nchanges immediately without clearing your cache, you can change your browser cache settings to control the problem.\n1. In Firefox's menu, select Tools >\u00a0Options.\n2. Select the Advanced tab, and then the Network tab.\n\n3. In the Offline Storage section, enter 0 for the MB of space used for the cache.(3024655)\nSmart Client Extension for Revit known limitations\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nUncatalog. With Revit 2022 running on Windows 11, you cannot select Asset Type on the Uncatalog form. (AD-10027)\nFile names with special characters. When you publish a Revit file whose file name contains spaces and characters such as #+\u00b0$(), you may receive an error\nmessage when viewing the SVG file in Web Central. (WC-3132)\nNames of models and levels. Currently, the Smart Client Extension for Revit does not support model names or level names containing the '-' character.(AD-9418)\nOpening a model. Error message. Due to the way that Updater classes are implemented, Revit presents a message that you are missing a third-party updater.\nYou can ignore this message. (SMAR-974).\nNumber.\nIf you Number a room and then use the Smart Client to show the Room field \"Perimeter ft\u201d, the perimeter shows as 0. If you Data Edit or Data Edit\nMultiple, the number is corrected. (SMAR-285)\nIf the database does not contain enough information for the Number command to execute, it fails to number instead of providing feedback to the user\nabout what database information is needed to successfully run the command. (SMAR-526)\nDeleting rooms. Revit does not notify Archibus when Revit deletes rooms. Currently, Archibus cannot uncatalog rooms on that event. Use the Synchronization /\nUncatalog Records without Assets command to clear the Drawing Name and Id fields on these rooms in one step.\nWeb Query. If the last primary key value for an asset is a single digit (e.g. if you query for room \"1\"), then the pop up dialog results are not restricted to that one\nrecord. This doesn't occur for two- and three-digit IDs (e.g. room \"10\" or \"100\"). (3035367, 3035366, 3034950, 3034414)\nPublish Enterprise Graphics. Colors. Since Revit floor plans do not have color, colors for Enterprise Graphics generated from Revit can cause confusion,\nespecially since the user does not have control over this. In a future release, Archibus will address this issue. (SMAR-988)\nEdit Data\u00a0\nRooms. Some objects in linked models are not correctly picking up room codes of the rooms they are inside of. (SMAR-785)\nGroup Areas. For new groups, the Group Code will show as \"1\" until the record is actually saved. Thereafter, the proper autonumbered ID will show.\n(3034828)\nSuite Areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0. If\nyou press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nLong parameter values. If you have a parameter value (e.g. Name) mapped to an Archibus field (e.g. Option 1), and that parameter has an existing\nvalue longer than the field width in Archibus, then you will not be able to create a record using Edit Data. You can shorten the parameter value using the\nRevit Parameters dialog. Alternately, if you use the Archibus Catalog command, the command will find all of these conditions and allow you to rectify them\nindividually or in groups. (3034793)\nMap Database Fields. This form is empty if there are no assets in the model of the specified asset type. (3034357)\nCopy / Paste. If you copy and paste furniture and equipment, you also copy and paste their Revit properties. Use the Archibus synchronization commands to\nfind and resolve any duplicates. (3030989)\nOutlook Plugin known limitations\nRegistry Entry to Keep Enabled. To ensure the Plugin cannot be disabled by users and will not be disabled automatically by Outlook, you must replace the\nfollowing DWORD registry value (which is added by the standard installer)\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=dword:1\nwith a string value.\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=\"1\"\nThis replacement can be implemented by customizing the Outlook Plugin MSI installer with a customization tool such as Master Packager. (AD-10391)\nSystem Administration known limitations\nBMS\u00a0Integration. The Technologies / Innovative Solutions / Integrations - BMS / Configure BMS Analysis (ab-iot-bms-configure-analysis.axvw) view has an \"add\nnew\" option which is not functioning. (AD-7901)\nSecurity. LDAP. The result of using a distinguished name with a comma results in this error in archibus.log: \"LDAP: error code 49 - Invalid Credentials\". The\nsolution is to change the bind user's \"CN=\" value to a name that does not contain a comma. (3037258)\nSecurity. SSO. In SSO mode, when the user name is incorrect, the user is redirected to the timeout page instead of the SSO error page. (WC-2027)\nSolution Templates. IofT. The Technologies / Innovative Solutions /Integrations - IoT / IoT Space Utilization solution template is not Oracle-compatible. (AD-8296)\nSolution Templates. Calendar Control. The Reservations Calendar example records multiple days for one-day events. (WC-3237)\nConnectListener. When ConnectListener runs, it does not move the previous afm_conn_log entries to afm_conn_logh. (AD-7003)\nSchema Change Wizard. The archibus.log fails to show correctly field and table name in the global dataset. This is only a logging issue. There is no functional\nerror. (3033565)\nGrid. API. Grid panels can display custom values calculated in Java Script code. An example can be seen in the following view. This example displays the\ncustom Location field that is composed from Building, Floor, Room, and Location database fields. The example also includes a menu that allows the user to\nproduce reports with the grid data. Due to Web Central technical implementation limitation, custom values formatted in Java Script code cannot be displayed in\nthese reports. (3041685)\nPath: Technologies / User Interface Add-Ins / Assemblies with Multiple Panels / Find-Manage with Categories\nFile: ab-products\\solutions\\assemblies\\work-wizard\\ab-ex-work-wizard.js\nFunction: updateLocations()\nGrid. API. When designing views with a grid panel, you cannot set specific grid column width in pixels. The grid automatically sets column widths according to\nthe available space and the data displayed in each column. (3045398)\nGrid. API. The Clear Filter icon is not visible if the last grid column is hidden. To avoid the issue, add an empty last column. The condition does not affect any of\nthe Archibus applications. (3040363)\nDatabase known limitations\nDatabase Update Wizard. runDuw.sql script. The Database Update Wizard generates an SQL script called runDuw.sql. When writing this file, it does not\nreplace macros with SQL. (AD-10595)\nMobile Framework known limitations\nFail to log in again when reloading mobile client. iOS. If you log in, close mobile client, and then attempt to log in again, you will find that you cannot log in.\nThe failure stems from being already logged into the OIDC connector and trying to reestablish a session. IOS has not been fully upgraded for service workers\ndue to extra restrictions service workers have in IOS Safari. Therefore IOS still requires the connection checks. A workaround is to wait until the OIDC session is\n\ninvalid/logged out, as well as not selecting \"remember me\" (for example in Okta) while on IOS. Not closing the app while there is a valid session will avoid this\nissue entirely. This is not an issue for Android. (AD-6517)\nSurveys. Measurement questions. Android. With the survey (questionnaire) features in both Maintenance and Compliance Surveys mobile apps, users can\nenter non-numeric values for Measurement questions. These values do not correctly upload when the mobile apps are synced. A future version will add\nvalidation so that users can input only numbers as the answer of Measurement type questions. (AD-4600)\nMobile App known limitations\nCompliance Surveys. Questionnaires. If a questionnaire requires a service request and the service request is created and then deleted, the questionnaire will\nstill indicate the service request step is complete. (AD-9047)\nMaintenance. Resources. If you add resources, such as parts, tools, and costs, you will not see the new resource records in both Resource Details form. Thus,\nyou might think the resource records were not added. After syncing, you will see that the resource record were successfully added. (AD-5908)\nMaintenance.uniqueidentifier Error. Due to Archibus resetting an application parameter for use with OnSite, users of the Maintenance mobile app will\nencounter the \"uniqueidentifier property to be defined\" error after completing a checklist or refreshing the screen. To resolve this, run System / Archibus\nAdministrator - Application Configuration / Configure Application Parameters and reset the AbCommonResources.MobileSyncDataChangesOnlyTables\napplication parameter to: bl;eq;rm;rmpct;dv;dp;fl;em;pt_store_loc_pt. (AD-11666, AD-11679)\nMaintenance. Checklists. Android 11. If you try to create a request from a work request's checklist, you receive a blank screen. This occurs only on Android 11.\n(AD-5863)\nMaintenance. Stopping Work. Supervisors cannot stop a work request that has a pending checklist. (AD-4883)\nMaintenance. Reopening a Checklist when Verifying It. If a supervisor reopens a checklist during the verify process, the work request correctly moves back to\nthe Issued status. If this work request's checklist is still pending and the supervisor or craftsperson now selects multiple work requests to complete (including this\none), you will find that you can complete this work request despite the fact that it has an open checklist. The issue does not occur when working from the My\nWork form because the form does not support multi-select action. (AD-4882)\nMaintenance. Confirmation. SLAs can contain Confirmation steps on the \"Issued\" and \"Completed\" statuses. Users who are assigned to these steps can\nperform the confirmation (Approve/Reject/Cancel) in the Maintenance Console, but this feature is not supported in the mobile Maintenance app. Confirmation\nsteps work only on the \"Requested\" and \"Assigned to Work Order\" statuses on mobile. (AD-7267)\nMaintenance. Sync Issues.\nWhen a user performs a Sync action on the mobile Maintenance app, any craftspersons hours data (such as Actual Hours or Overtime Hours) can be\noverwritten if those hours were entered in Web Central. (3045897)\nWhen a requestor reports multiple maintenance requests of the same type from different locations and then syncs to upload all the requests at once, the\nmobile app does not consistently upload all the requests. To avoid this problem, sync after entering each request. (3048805).\nPart quantities are synced on the mobile Maintenance app only when you sync the background data. This affects mobile users who perform any of the\nfollowing actions on the mobile maintenance application:\no Estimate parts on a work request\no Add purchased parts to inventory\no Complete a work request that includes parts\nAfter you perform any of these actions and sync, the system will update the part quantities correctly in the database and they will appear correctly in Web\nCentral; however, the mobile application will not show these new quantities. Also, any changes made by other mobile users or Web Central users to the\npart quantities will not be synced. The workaround is to go the Sync settings on the mobile application and click the button that says \u201cReset Background\nData Sync Flag\u201d. When you return to the Maintenance application, the background data will automatically sync, and the part quantities will be updated on\nthe device. (3053237)\nMaintenance. Seeing Rejected Requests. Approvers can reject requests back to the requestor or step completer. However, mobile users cannot see or\nresubmit those rejected requests from the mobile application. This must be done from the Building Operations Console.(3048370)\nMaintenance. Photos. You can request maintenance from the Workplace Services Portal app and the Maintenance app, and you can update maintenance\nrequests from the Maintenance app. However, the two apps store maintenance photos in different tables (wr and activity_log), which can cause problems when\nediting or deleting a photo. When you request maintenance using the Workplace Services Portal app and add a photo, and then access the corresponding work\nrequest using the Maintenance app, the photo will be shown. However, if later the photo is deleted by the Maintenance team from the work request (wr) record,\nthe photo will not be deleted from the activity_log record, and vice versa. There are several alternative scenarios for adding, changing, or deleting photos which\nmay cause this kind of issue. This issue will be fixed in a future release. (3047423)\nWorkplace Portal. Chinese. If you enter a space after a Building Code value, you will encounter an error with Rooms / Locate Employee. (AD-5913)\nWorkplace Services known limitations\nService Desk known limitations\nManage Request Types. Non-English Locale. When using the Service Desk / Service Desk Manager / Manage Request Types view (ab-create-activitytype-\ntabs.axvw) to edit request types that have been translated into other locales, the request type does not appear correctly in Service Desk Manager edit form. (AD-\n2813)\nReservations known limitations\nArchibus Extension for Exchange Integration. Reservation with No Subject. If you create a reservation with no subject, the message stays in the user's\ncalendar and the reservation cannot be found in Archibus; the reservation errors out in the log because the subject is empty. (AD-13528)\nReservations Calendar Console. Attendees in Room. Does not correctly set the \u201cAttendees in Room\u201d field value when creating meetings; there is no way for\na user to manually edit this value. (AD-4856)\nReservations Calendar Console. Double-byte Characters and Comments Field. The Calendar Console presents an error message when you attempt to\nconfirm a reservation whose comment includes double-byte characters and is larger than 4000 characters. As a workaround, enter smaller comments when a\ncomment includes double-byte characters. (AD-436)\nReservations Calendar Console. Recurring Reservations for Monthly Meetings. The timeline does not always correctly display recurring patterns for\nmonthly meetings. For example, if you created a reservation for the first Monday of the month, the Reservations Calendar Console might show all Mondays in\nthe month. Although the timeline might not display these reservations correctly, the Console does correctly save these meeting dates and the summary text\nreflects the proper date. (APP-6651)(AD-1028)\nReservations Calendar Console. Room Configurations. For situations in which multiple reservations exist at the same time in the same room, but for different\nroom configurations, the calendar displays only one reservation. (APP-6561)\nReservations Calendar Console. Continuous Meetings. The system does not prompt you resolve continuous meetings that have conflicts; when it encounters\nthis situation, the system generates a workflow rule error. (APP-6535)\nReservations Calendar Console. Conference Calls.\nIf you create a conference call and you select several buildings in order to select rooms in several buildings; and if many of the rooms in one building are\nreservable, all of the rooms for this building are shown, and reservable rooms from other buildings are not displayed. This can make hard to select rooms\nfrom different buildings. The TimelineMaxRoomsPerBuilding application parameter does not control this.(APP-6214)\nYou cannot edit the date and time of a conference call reservation. (APP-6613)\nReservations Calendar Console. Changing Room Selection.Time not Recorded. If you select a room, select a time, add some resources, and select\nanother room; you will find that the designated time does not persist to the second room. (APP-6800)\nReservations Calendar Console. Application Parameters. The TimelineStartTime and TimelineEndTime parameters work only with one-hour\nincrements. If you enter times such as 9:30 and 17:30 in the parameters, the Calendar Console does not consider them. (APP-6698)\nCreate Resource Reservation. Reservation Timeline. Microsoft Surface. You cannot drag with touch input a reservation on the timeline. Timeline drag-and-\ndrop supports only mouse events. (APP-3312)\n\nOutlook Plugin. My Reservations. When the Outlook Plugin displays the My Reservations, the popup is opened without the option to edit any of the\nreservations showed, so users cannot add resources. The Add Reservation button is also disabled. (AD-4846)\nGoogle Calendar Integration. When you have configured the application for \"no integration\" with Exchange, the .ics files that are generated to be imported into\nOutlook, Google Calendar, or any other calendar app, sometimes do not correctly update the Google Calendar application. Specifically, there can be a problem\nwith the file content related to the meeting identifiers created by the application. These meeting identifiers are not always unique. If you create a new calendar,\ninstead of importing an existing one, the creation of meetings seems to work correctly for single and recurring reservations, but updates and cancellations don\u2019t\nalways work as expected.\nSpace known limitations\nView and Print Floor Plan. If Room Category and Room Type have the same value, only one value is displayed in the drawing. (AD-10178)\nSpace Console. Export What You See. If you select multiple floor plans to display, only the first displayed floor plan is exported. All visible floor plans should\nexport. (AD-12658)\nSpace Console. Bulk editing rooms. If you select from the floor plan more than 10 rooms and attempt to bulk-edit them, the form may not display all the fields\nand buttons making it difficult or impossible to edit the selected rooms. When editing rooms in bulk, edit fewer than 10 rooms at one time. (AD-2711)\nSpace Console. Generate Ad Hoc PDF. Large Drawings. For large drawings, such as one with an SVG size of 5590K, the report may not generate. In these\ncases, increase the memory, such as increasing the Tomcat memory to 2048 M. (AD-2048)\nSpace Console. Employees tab. Selecting Employees. If you have a list of employees that runs over multiple pages, when you select employees and then\nmove to \"Next\" or \"Previous\" page, the selection will be cleared. As a workaround, you can first use the \"Place Employee in Waiting Room\" or \"Unassign\" action\nfor the selected employees on the current page, and then move to a different page to select additional employees. (AD-2741)\nSpace Console. Team Space. Organization Name field. When assigning associations to teams, you will see that the Associations tab includes the\nOrganization Name field. This is validated by the Organizational Units (org) table. To create the values for the Organizational Units table so that they are\navailable when completing the Organization Name field, you must use the Smart Client. Create a new view that holds the org table and use this view to define\nyour organizational units. (3052882)\nSpace Console. Plan Types. Using Plan Types on the Space Console affords the user the ability to personalize highlights, text labels, and printed legends to\nthe deployment's needs, in addition to the pre-existing highlights and label options that exist on the Space Console's drop-down menus. The Add-In Manager\ndefines Plan Type highlights and labels by creating or modifying view files and datasources that are logged in the active_plantypes table. However, to make\nchanges or add legend datasources, in addition to defining those datasources in the view file that active_plantypes references, the Add-In manager must:\n1. Make an associated change in the same view file for a highlight datasource, and name it as the legend is named. For example, if the Add-In Manager\nmakes a legend datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend\", they must also make an associated highlight datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-\nhl-rm-by-dp-name_rmHighlight\".\n2. In the PDF export AXVW file ab-sp-console-export-drawing-pdf.axvw, the Add-in Manager must also create a legend-type panel and refer to the\nnew legend datasource. Following the same example, the panel's id must be named panel_ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend, and the\ndatasource must equal ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend. The fields that the datasource defines and that should be visible in the legend must\nbe defined in that panel. (3050005)\nSpace Requests. Moves. If you change the From Location in a space request, use Space / Moves / Move Coordinator / Complete Group Moves to close the\nmove, and check the rmpct record, you will see that the value for primary_em is still 0. It should change to 1 since user has changed the From Location from\nsatellite location to primary location. The conditions for this situation are: workspace transactions are enabled, the SLA for Group Move calls for the service\nprovider as Move Management and no approvers, and the application parameters are: InferRoomDepartments=0 and\nAssignUnallocatedSpace=ProrateFloor. (3043629)\nMoves. Action Questionnaires. If you add new Action Types (using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Types task), you cannot add\nquestionnaires to these new action types using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Questionnaires task. (3028382)\nMaintenance known limitations\nNon-English Locales. Tagging in Comments. When you tag someone in a comment using OnSite or Web Central, the system generates an email; under a\nnon-English locale, the strings in both email title and email body are not translated. Non-translated text includes: the string 'tagged you in work request' in both\nemail title and email body, as well as all the strings for work request parameters in email body. (AD-9394)\nTime Zones. You will encounter the wrong time zone in work orders (11:57 AM instead of 1:57 PM) if you select the \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value as the time zone using\nthe Define Geographical Locations view. Instead, select a city-specific time zone such as \"Europe/Paris timezone(UTC+1)\". The \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value will be\nremoved in the future as it is not necessary. (AD-8802)\nMaintenance Console. Sorting. The first time that you sort the Maintenance Console's grid by a field it correctly sorts; if you sort by the same fields multiple\ntimes, the sort does not work and the arrow in the header row does not update correctly. (AD-7932)\nCraftsperson Sample Data. In the sample HQ project, there are many records in Craftspersons (cf) table that do not have email account; also many have\nduplicated email accounts like no-response@archibustgd.com. The key convention for the workflow is: cf.email=em.email=afm_users.email. These\nvalues must be unique. To fix this issue, just remove those records from the cf table for which emails are either empty or have duplicated value. Below are some\nsituations where duplicated values can cause problems\nLaunch SLA console, dispatch to supervisor, click Select Value, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_supervisor=1\nContinue to add a estimation step, select employee to do estimation, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_estimator=1\nLaunch the Maintenance Console, click any work request, click the Forward button, select supervisor, you will see all employees instead of all meeting the\nrestriction: cf.is_supervisor=1.(AD-6744)\nCraftspersons. Notifications.For SLAs that are configured so craftspersons are to be notified when work is issued (notify craftsperson check-box), the\ncraftsperson is not receiving notification when the work is issued. (AD-4960)\nAssets known limitations\nAsset Lifecycle Console. Classification Filter. When you filter for a classification, in the Select Value list associated with the Classification filter, the\nClassifications tree expands automatically up to the second level. The returned classification results may be at lower levels, so you may need to manually\nexpand the tree to see everything. Ideally, the Asset Lifecycle Console would automatically expand to the appropriate level; however, it expands only to the\nsecond level due to potential performance issues on larger inventories of assets. ( AD-10324 )\nAsset Disposal Console. Changing Building Status from Asset Disposal Console Causes Inconsistencies in REPM. The Asset Disposal Console updates\nthe asset records for Buildings and Properties as well as inserts OT records to match when the asset is disposed of. REPM reports on Owned, Pipeline, and\nDisposed OT statuses for buildings, but ignores buildings with other ownership transaction statuses, or gives unexpected results in reports. The REPM Building\nAdd/Edit Wizard does not have a way to modify the status of the bl record. Setting the transaction Status to Owner does not change the status of the building to\nOwned. Coordinate OT records with asset status in both REPM and Disposal Console. (APP-852)\nDefine Classifications. Deleting Top Levels. In the Define Classification view (ab-ca-def-class.axvw, which is available from the Business Process\nOwner process of Asset Management, Condition Assessment, and Environmental Sustainability Assessment), you cannot delete a top level. Instead, you must\ndelete the top level by using Smart Client and deleting the record from the csi table. If you are not going to use a top-level classification hierarchy, it is advisable\nto delete all the child records (under the top level) before deleting the top level. (AD-6682)\nClassifications. Localization. Numeric ID (Automatic Lookup). The Classifications (csi) and Classification Standards (csi_std) tables are not translatable.\nTherefore, in order to use the Automatic Lookups (Numeric IDs) feature for asset classifications, enable Automatic Lookups for them without\nafm_scmpref.preferences. Otherwise, Archibus will look for the translatable fields in the two tables, resulting in application errors. Also, the Asset\nClassification Description field (csi.description) and the field Classification Standard Description (csi_std.description) are not translatable. If enabling\nthe Automatic Lookup for these fields, do not use the attribute displayType=\"translate\" because the fields are not translatable.(APP-4286) (AD-6683).\nEnterprise Assets known limitations\nProject Proposal Console. Baseline cost of a Billion Monetary Units or Greater. If you enter a baseline cost for an individual required asset that is a billion\nmonetary units or greater, you get an error that the value entered exceeds the maximum storage unit for the field. This is because the value for the baseline cost\nin the sb_items table is defined as numeric (9,1). However, the value you entered displays correctly in the grid and in the statistical summary because the value\nin the eq_req_items table is defined as numeric (16,2). This error occurs only in the rare case that the cost of an individual asset is a billion monetary units or\ngreater. (3052851)\n\nProject Proposal Console. Selected Period Fields not Displaying. The default selection is to display Baseline and Period 1. If you add other period fields but\nthen want to return to the default setting and find that the Console is not displaying your selection, clear your browser cache. (APP-1601)\nManage Reference Documents. This task enables you to associate a document with a Building Use, Property Type, and Furniture Standard. However, there is\ncurrently no way to view documents added for these items. It also enables you to associate a document with projects of different types. Currently, you are able to\nview documents for only projects that have the Scenario type. You are, however, able to view documents added for work request Problem Types, PM\nprocedures, and action items that are associated with a Proposed project. (3050281)\nAsset Portal known limitations\nView Equipment Plan. If you have a lot of asset symbols on the floor plan, they may not display the Equipment Code as asset text and may not be correctly\nfilled with color. (3028852)\nReal Property known limitations\nForecasting known limitations\nPortfolio Forecasting Wizard. Calculations. If the user units are different from the project units, when you calculate the area on the floor for an allocation event\nby multiplying headcount by average area per employee, the result can be off by a factor of 10.76. (3052105)\nStrategic Financial Analysis known limitations\nFinancial Analysis Console. VPA. The console does not load if the user has a VPA that is not compatible with the console restriction. Please see Adding VPA to\nthe Financial Analysis Console \u00a0for details on creating a VPA for this console. (3053673)\nSustainability &\u00a0Risk known limitations\nCompliance known limitations\nExtended Questionnaires. Service Requests from Mobile. Although the ability to create service requests from questionnaires was added to the Compliance\nSurveys mobile app, it has not yet been implemented in the Web Central Compliance application. Therefore, if a mobile questionnaire respondent provides\ndetails for a follow-up Service Request actions for any question in a questionnaire, then the respondent should take care to fully submit the questionnaire via the\nmobile app; they should not edit or submit via the Web Central questionnaire edit form because the Web Central edit form might not preserve the request details\nor set the status of the request as expected via the mobile app. (APP-4250)\nExtended Questionnaires. Assigned to Events. View my Events Calendar. The \"View My Events Calendar\" task for Compliance Program Coordinators does\nnot provide a link from events details to answer or review any questionnaires that might be attached to assigned events. The workaround is for Program\nCoordinators to use one of the other \"My... Events\" tasks to access assigned questionnaires. (APP-1667)\nExtended Questionnaires. Question Tree. Nodes without Child Records. In the Define Compliance Questionnaire view, when you examine a question that\nhas multiple choice answers, you will see that the Question Tree does not indicate that a node has no child content. When a node has no children, it still displays\nthe triangle-shaped icon for expanding and collapsing, giving the impression that there are child records. After you click the node, the triangle disappears until\nrefresh. (WC-2386)\nContracts and Compliance Programs with Cost Records. Deleting. You must first delete all assigned cost records associated with a contract or program or\nrequirement or term before you can delete the coordinating record. (APP-2276)\nHazard Abatement known limitations\nHomogeneous Areas not Highlighted. The application does not currently highlight all rooms identified as containing portions of homogeneous areas when\nthere are no assessments directly associated with those rooms. (APP-5240)\nWaste known limitations\nHazardous Waste Accumulation Report. The application stores and displays the hazardous waste accumulation volume limit application parameter value in\nunits of US Gallons. Users must take care to convert any other volume limit parameter into gallons if they adjust the application parameter controlling this. In any\ncase, the application does automatically and correctly convert the accumulated waste quantity to compare against this standard, no matter what units the waste\nhad been recorded in. (APP-5470)\nWaste Container Labels. The application generates formatted label documents for selected waste records. The web pop-up dialogue that shows the results of\nthe document creation has a bug limiting the display of outputted documents to 4 records. However, the application does still produce label documents for all the\nselected records as distinct files, named according to the waste record id number and saved to the .../WebCentral/schema/per-site/pdf-forms/[username] folder.\n(APP-5241)\nEnergy\u00a0known limitations\nProrating bills. Duplicate Bills. If you happen to enter duplicate bills for the same building and vendor with overlapping dates of service, and then attempt to\nauto-generate prorated bills, the application may encounter a duplicate primary key error when trying to generate one or more of the bill records. This is because\nthe resulting time periods will be the same, and the proration action will fail. (APP-5242, AD-924)\nConfigure Bill Processing. Excluded Bill Types. Archived Bills. The Configure Bill Processing view allows users to choose to exclude certain bill types from\nthe application's rules requiring bills to be archived in contiguous, ordered, monthly series. However, if an unusual situation occurs wherein a vendor account's\nutility bill type should change after some bills have already been archived, then the application will ignore a request to exclude the new bill type for new incoming\nbills for that vendor account. A work-around is to exclude both the old and new utility bill types from the monthly bill test. (APP-1855)\nProcess BAS Data View. The Web Central core does not yet support grid indexes on dates fields or on calculated fields. For example, if you create an index on\na date field having the value 2014-01-01, the value first shows as \u20182 \u2013 All.\u2019 If you click the \u20182\u2019 option, the value changes to \u201820\u2019; click the \u201820\u2019 and it's transformed to\n\u2018201\u2019; click the \u2018201\u2019 and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2019; click again, and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2026.\u2019 This issue appears in the right \u201cClean num\u201d panel in Energy\nManagement's Process BAS Data view. (WC-3108)\nView Prorated and Aggregated Bills. In rare cases, when the sum of aggregated bills exceeds a value 1000000 in the chosen display units, the application will\npresent an alert message stating that the value of the calculated field exceeds the field's maximum. In this view, the user may safely dismiss this message and\nproceed to view the bill record. (APP-5270)\nGreen Building known limitations\nFuel Density. Tree Panel. The Green Building / Background Data - Carbon footprint / Fuel Density task has a tree panel that manages two different levels of\ninformation. The tree panel does not display the second level. As a workaround, you can enter data so that both levels are shown, and then remove the data. (AD-\n1618)\nCapital Projects known limitations\nProjects known limitations\nProjects. Importing from Microsoft Project. From the Projects / Execute / Procure task / Import tab you can import an *.xml file from Microsoft Project.\nDepending on your version of Microsoft Project, you may need to choose to \u201cOpen as a new project.\" Otherwise, you may encounter errors with the\npredecessors values if you decide to append the data or merge the data. (3011985)\nProject Template. VPA. With VPA active, if you use the Projects / Set Up / Define Template Projects task to create a new project and enter a Project Type and\nTitle, you will find that the process fails and a template project is not created. As a work-around, add NULL to the Site VPA list; this allows a Project record to be\ngenerated. (AD-8105)\nConnectors known limitations\nReserved Words. Archibus does not support field names with reserved words. For example, adding the field \"alter\" to the table bl, causes the Archibus\napplication server to fail to start when attempting to restart it. Therefore, the INBOUND use case of importing data into an Archibus table that has a field named\nwith a reserved word is not supported. The OUTBOUND use case of exporting data to a remote system like BUILDER SMS that has a database field that uses a\nreserved word (ex. order) is supported. (APP-3975)(APP-4769)\n\nEDI Example. The example file provided for the EDI connector in the HQ project demonstrates Web Central\u2019s ability to process EDI data formats, but only\naddresses the bill table. Since the example lacks a bill_lines connector definition and a bill connector association, it is not possible to fully load a complete utility\nbill using the EDI connector example. In the future, we plan to make a new example that is more realistic available for download. (3047882)\nBackslash Character. In some environments entering \\\\ in connector field parameters or connector parameters may result in the \\\\ being saved as \\. As a\nworkaround, for a field enter \\\\\\\\ for \\\\ every time you save the field. For connector parameters, avoid use of \\\\; or, use \\\\\\\\ and fix configuration in post\nprocess. (3045250, 3047842)\nSaving. Saving a connector does not display the standard \u201cRecord Successfully Saved\u201d banner.(3045250)\nExtensions for BUILDERTM SMS known limitation\nAsset Attributes. Numeric Values. Separators. When entering numerical values for an asset attribute (ex. Quantity) do not enter a numeric separator such as\na comma. If a comma is entered in the asset attribute value as a numeric separator, the connector framework will not know how to process the comma and the\ndata transfer to BUILDER SMS will fail. (APP-5603)\nOutbound Connector. Condition Assessment Items. The master outbound connector SMS_ARCHIBUS_BUILDER_Inspect exports all condition assessment\nitems for a given section with date assessed in the past 90 days or within the number of days from current date set in the application parameter\nAbCapitalPlanningCA-BUILDER_InspectionDate_NewerThan and not only the most recent condition assessment record for the that section and for that\ntime interval. (APP- 4090)\nInbound Connectors. Number of Buildings. Sites do not record number of buildings transferred in from BUILDERTM SMS for the specific site. (APP-2401)\nInbound Connectors. Sections. Sections measured in pieces with quantity higher than 1 will not be split into multiple pieces of equipment when imported into\nArchibus. When transferring sections from BUILDERTM SMS measured in pieces and that have a quantity larger than one, Archibus does not create multiple\npieces of equipment. It creates only one piece of equipment with the corresponding value for the quantity attribute. (APP-2138)\nOutbound Connectors. Organizations and Sites. For new organizations and new sites transferred from Archibus to BUILDERTM SMS, the OUTBOUND\nconnectors do not set values to these BUILDERTM SMS fields:\nOrganization.UpdateCosts\nOrganization.UpdateCurves\nOrganization.ORG_ACF\nOrganization.ORG_SEISMICZONE\nOrganization.ORG_CI\nOrganization.ORG_FI\nOrganization.ORG_PI\nOrganization.ORG_FCI\nBUILDERTM SMS displays new organizations as new sites transferred from Archibus to BUILDERTM SMS, even without setting values to the above fields.\nBUILDERTM SMS users can enter the values for these fields using the BUILDERTM SMS interface. Running the OUTBOUND master connector a second time\nwill not affect the values entered by BUILDERTM SMS users for these fields. (APP-3215)\nArchibus V.2024.04\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Eptura, Inc.

Since V.25.2, Sybase has been available only for demonstration and training, and has not been tested for production deployment. In V.2023.02\nSystem Management Help, we have removed the Sybase topics. If you use Sybase as a testing environment, you can consult the Sybase topics in archived\nV.2023.01 System Management Help. (DOC-3137)\nClient/Server Topics. Beginning with V.25.1, Windows Client/Server compatibility has not been supported, although the features supporting Client/Server\ncompatibility remained in Web Central and Smart Client. Users who wanted to work with the Client/Server compatibility features, used a pre-V.25.1 version of\nArchibus. Given that Client/Server compatibility has not supported for several releases, we have removed the Client/Server topics from the System Management\nHelp. If you need the Client/Server topics, consult archived V.2023.01 System Management Help. (DOC-3138)\nSingle User and Small Workgroup Deployment Topics. Since these deployments have not been available for some time, we have removed the topics from\nSystem Management Help. If you require them, consult the archived V.2023.01 System Management Help.

The Foundations package now includes the Archibus Geospatial Extensions for Esri. In future releases, this license\nwill be enabled as part of Foundations.\u00a0In the meantime, contact Archibus Customer Support if you need this license activated. (DOC-3225)\n\nChanges in Web Central\nBIM Viewer\nBuildings Drop-down Menu. With the addition of the Projects List for accessing all projects, the BIM Viewer's Buildings drop-down list now presents only those\nbuildings cataloged in Archibus. (AD-13327)\nSearch for Equipment Standards. This command has been added to the BIM\u00a0Viewer's ribbon menu so that you can search for equipment standards\nBIM\u00a0families and BIM categories; you can also drill down to the attributes associated with a standard. (AD-13319)\nFilter. The filter now has a \"Only Buildings with Models?\" option that restricts the Assets and the Work Requests panels to only buildings that have Forge\nmodels. (AD-12970)\nFilter. Group by Systems. Previously if you filtered to a building by choosing the Building button and then grouped by systems, you would see systems in all the\nbuildings. Group by systems now reflects the filter. (AD-12319)\nAutodesk Platform Services SDK. We have upgraded the BIM Viewer to Autodesk Platform Services SDK v7.86.0 . Refer to Autodesk Platform Services\nchange log to see the benefits of upgrading to v7.86.0 at https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/change_history/changelog_v7/(AD-12725)\nEquipment Systems. The System tree now enables you to easily move assets to different systems or within the same system by dragging and dropping them\ninto the correct position within the system. This is the same behavior as found in the Equipment Systems Console. (AD-12881)\nNested Families. The BIM\u00a0Viewer now supports locating and highlighting nested families. (AD-11499)\nExport. You can now export the list of Assets to XLS. (AD-11612)\nAdditional Highlights. We have added additional highlights for rooms, including: Room Standard, Super Categories, Status, Available and Hotelable, Not\nSurveyed. (AD-11758)\nCatalog BIM Models. Minor UX enhancements and layout fixes. (AD-12420)\nZooming. We have improved the zooming features. (AD-12486)\nPerformance. When working with Autodesk Construction Cloud repositories that have a very large set of models (ex. over 50), you will find that the errors about\nexceeding data limits have been resolved.\nUnresponsive Highlights. The highlights in the BIM Viewer became unresponsive after six minutes of working with the same building or six minutes of inactivity.\nThis was because the datasource became unresponsive. This has been corrected and you no longer need to reload the view and then set the highlights again.\n(AD-12120)\nEquipment Labels. After you loaded a floor from the Levels drop-down and turned on the Equipment labels, the BIM Viewer displayed the labels for all the\nequipment in the building instead of just the labels for the equipment on the floor being visualized. This has been corrected. (AD-12488)\nAsset Selection when Switching Floors.\u00a0Previously, if you selected in the Asset list equipment on multiple floors and then loaded a new floor plan, the assets\non the new floor plan were not highlighted. We have corrected this so that the assets on the newly-loaded floor plan are highlighted. (AD-12487)\nInterface\nAddressed error when submitting a license file using Set up License for Clustered Deployment\nAddressed issue where icons on grids would become disabled after a refresh\nAddressed issue in legends where the value contains a dash or the legend contains a large number of entries\nAddressed errors when attempting to run Basic Rule Wizard\nCertain characters which are encoded in HTML are now displayed correctly in grids\nEnsured Edit Drawing Publishing Rules display all SVG and EMF publishing rules\nImproved message when deleting records succeeds\nMake display of date in Database Revision view consistent in Oracle\nRemove obsolete items from View Program Information and License Usage\nVisual improvements to Navigator menu and branding\nExport\nAddressed error generating a Paginated Report with no restriction\nAddressed error exporting to Excel where a restriction could cover data. (DOC- 2749, AD-11606)\nAddressed error exporting to Excel from Report Central\nAddressed error exporting to Excel from the Space Console with a restriction\nChanges in Workplace\nService Requests. Request Types with Questions. Displaying User Responses. The following issue has been resolved: If you make a request in Workplace\nfor a Request Type that has questions and also has a Problem Type, the user's responses to the questions do not display in the Workplace Services / Service\nDesk / Client / View Service Requests task; the responses are correctly recorded as XML in the activity_log.act_quest field. \u00a0Requests for Request Types\nthat do not have a value for Problem Type do successfully display the user response. (AD-12927)\nUX. \"Meeting Reservation\" changed to \"Meeting Space Booking.\" \u00a0Based on user feedback, we have changed titles, buttons, and message text that\ncontains \"Meeting Reservation\" to \"Meeting Space Booking.\" (AD-13340)\nWorkspace Booking. Search for Employee. Previously, if you searched for an employee near whom you wanted to book a space and there was no available\nspace on the employee's floor, you were redirected to another floor with space with no explanation. Now, in this situation, you land on the same floor as the\nsearched employee and there\u2019s an a message that there are no available seats on this floor. (AD-12901)\nWorkspace Bookings. Booking Multiple Seats. Floor Capacity Target. The following issue has been resolved: When the application is set up such that\nAbSpaceHotelling-AllowMultipleBookings is set to Yes and AbSpaceHotelling-EnforceFloorCapacityTarget is set to Yes, when users\nencounter a room with more than 1 seat available, they have the option to book multiple seats in their own name. However, users can book up to the total\nnumber of available seats in this room, even if it exceeds the Floor Capacity Target set for this floor. They will be able to proceed with the booking and exceed\nthe Floor Capacity Target. The next person who tries to book on the floor, however, will be prevented from making any further bookings. (AD-7498).\nAccessibility Mode. Pre-block and Post-block Times. Workplace now displays a message that pre- and post-block times are considered in the search for\nmeeting rooms: \u201dAvailable times are automatically adjusted to meet the following requirements...\" (AD-11661)\nAccessibility Mode. On the floor plan view, we have improved the meeting room and workspace availability messages that display when the user hovers over a\nroom. These messages adhere to accessibility standards. (AD-11284)\nAccessibility Mode. Service Catalog. If Accessibility Mode was enabled, the /archibus/schema/ab-products/essential/workplace/index.html?\naction=servicecatalog URL displayed the pre-V2022.02 Service Catalog view and did not display the Dashboard, as is the behavior for V2022.02 and beyond\nwithout Accessibility Mode. This was resolved in V.2023.01 but not listed in the V.2023.01 revision history. (AD-8901)\nSSO. If you closed the browser without fully signing out, you were not able to sign in again until either the Web Central session expired, or a hard refresh was\nperformed in the browser. This has been resolved in most circumstances; the Known Limitations lists an exception when using tablets. (AD-12162, AD-12870)\nLogging. Workplace logging now reports if the landing page (index.html) has been cached. This can be valuable for troubleshooting. Consult the log by using\nF12 to enable Developer Tools and then click on the Console tab. (AD-13163)\nEmployees Tagged in Comments. In order to display comments in which employees have been tagged, Workplace now consults the following fields in\nComments: em.name, em.em_id, and the em.name_first and em.name_last combination. This resolves a problem in which some employees, such as sample\nemployee Allison Abernathy, were not seeing comments in which they were tagged. (AD-12491)\nEmployee Details popup, When AbEssentialFacility-SelfServiceSearch was set to 0, the Workspace Booking screen was incorrectly showing employee details\nabout the employees who had booked spaces on the floor plan you are viewing. We have corrected this so that Workplace does not show employee details with\nthis setting. (AD-12586)\n\nVPA. A problem with floor plans not loading under some VPA conditions has been corrected. (AD-13149)\nLocalized. The calendar is now fully translated in a custom language. (AD-13028)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nFloor Selection. Accessibility Mode. The floor selector buttons were replaced with drop-down lists. In both modes, Workplace now uses floor selector buttons.\n(AD-9844)\nChanges in OnSite Configuration\nThe OnSite mobile app is not updated as part of V.2023.02. However, we did make changes to the Manage Configurations for OnSite task. These pertain to OnSite V6.\nIn the Workflow tab, you can now specify what fields the craftsperson must enter when completing their work. (AD-13512)\nIn the Display Options tab, you can now specify additional fields, such as Other Costs, that can be hidden from the OnSite display. (AD-13511)\nIn the General tab, there are new option for specifying Timer-related configurations. (AD-12692)\nIn the Notifications tab, users with a locale of Chinese now receive an informational message: \u201cTechnicians might not see the notifications on their mobile device.\nThey need to access the OnSite Notifications tab to view all of them.\u201d This is required because Chinese users will not receive notifications from Push Service\nhosted by Google, due to the ban on Google in China. (AD-10430)\nChanges in Smart Client, Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD and Revit\nGeneral Smart Client, Extension for AutoCAD, and Extension for Revit\nSecurity. Multiple security issues addressed\nSSO. A problem with SSO not compatible with AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) with sticky sessions has been resolved. (AD-12579)\nSign out: Resolved a problem with licenses not being released in SSO environments. (AD-12925)\nPublish: Publishing would fail and display an error message stating \"Access to path\u2026 denied\" if the path was not configured properly in Web Central. This has\nbeen resolved. (AD-12713)\nSmart Client\nMain screen: Corrected a problem with the displayed text was tiny on high-DPI monitors. (AD-12815)\nSmart Client Extension for AutoCAD\nPublishing. We have corrected a problem with drawings using mm units not publishing some blocks to the published floor plan. (AD-12490)\nAutoCAD supported versions. Support added for AutoCAD 2024. (AD-12669)\nInsert Asset. The following issue has been resolved: The Insert Asset logic doesn\u2019t take into account the AssetTypeDetail.ParameterUnits value when\ninserting the asset. Therefore, in a drawing with Imperial/Architectural units, running the Insert Asset command on the RM layer inserts the asset in inches rather\nthan feet. (AD-7470)\nSmart Client Extension for Revit\nMap Database Fields. Would not work with certain models This has been corrected. (AD-13493)\nInfer. Equipment option not available for instance elements when they were first added to the model. This has been corrected. (AD-11248)\nPublish. Rooms would be missing from an exported DOCX and PDF exports from the Space Console for some models This has been corrected.(AD-12452)\nPublishing. An error when publishing 2D if the Smart Client Locale is set to French has been resolved. (AD-11893)\nChanges in Database\nSee the following topic in System Management Help:\u00a0Database Schema Revision History.\nChanges in Platform\nSecurity\nImproved access restriction to assigned views.\nLogging out while user has jobs running now always logs the user out.\nAdded warning in log to set APP_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD if using default.\nThe workflow rule flushCachedUserRoles is now a privileged operation restricted to administrators.\nOpting out of usage analytics will correctly disable all analytics.\nHardening against unauthorized path traversal.\nHardening against session fixation.\nHardening against External Entity Inject (XXE) attacks.\nUpdated 60 java libraries; removed four redundant libraries; added three libraries to support new features\nIncreased minimum Java version to Java 11.\nLogging\nAdded slf4j provider to ensure complete logging.\nBack End\nAccommodate viewName ending in axvw when referencing a data source.\nChanged default project to FirstActiveProject generally.\nMore consistent and persistent data source resolution and caching, but the core.preloadFileIndex is ignored (always true).\nData source caching was improved at the cost of start-up time and configuration.\nSupport for parameterized queries in cross table views.\nOther\nNew Eclipse environment\nDeployment\nWe made a deployment configuration setting change in the header of Apache\u2019s httpd.conf so that mobile app sessions are now properly reinstated on SSO\nenvironments in cases of the browser being closed without signing out. (AD-12770)\nChanges in Mobile Framework and Mobile Apps\nThere were no code changes to the Sencha mobile apps and mobile framework in V.2023.02.\nChanges in Assets\n\nSee also the above section, Changes in BIM\u00a0Viewer.\nEquipment Standards. In the Define Equipment Standards view, the left-side panel displays additional fields. This will help you more easily identify the\nequipment standard to be modified. (AD-13810)\nArchibus Asset Families task. We have added a new Background Data task for defining records in the Archibus Asset Families. This table provides the values\nfor the new Asset Family field in the Equipment Standards table. (AD-12941)\nDefine Asset Attribute Standards task. We have added this task to the Assets / Background Data - Assets process for Archibus SaaS. Non-SaaS users can\nfind this task under Enterprise Asset Management / Background Data - Assets; in Non-SaaS deployments, this task is not available under Assets / Background\nData - Assets, but will be in a future release. (AD-14097, AD-12912)\nChanges in Space\nHighlight Occupiable Vacant Rooms. Previously, the Paginated Report button produced a report that included floor plans for all floors with vacant occupiable\nrooms. This has been corrected to include only the floor plan displayed in the report. (AD-12220)\nSpace & Portfolio Planning Console. We have corrected an issue when exporting data. (AD-9297)\nSpace. Console. Export. We upgraded the aspose words library, which fixed issues with PDF and SVG\u00a0export. (AD-11950, AD-12712)\nSpace Console. Legend. We have resolved a problem with legends when the division by which you are highlighting contains a dash character. (AD-12338)\nChanges in Maintenance\nMaintenance Console. Locale. Dates, such as Date to Perform, are now formatted per user locale. Likewise, days of the week are now translated and display\nin the user\u2019s locale. (AD-11895, AD-13112)\nMaintenance Console. Bulk Update. Craftspersons. When you perform a bulk update of work requests, you now make craftsperson assignments and enter\nwork logs using the Add Work Logs button instead of the Add Craftsperson button. (AD-11102)\nCraftsperson Availability. Filter. Previously, the Primary Trade Required filter was not working properly. This has been corrected. (AD-11178)\nBMS\u00a0Integration. The Technologies / Innovative Solutions / Integrations - BMS / Configure BMS Analysis (ab-iot-bms-configure-analysis.axvw) view has an \"add\nnew\" option which was not functioning. This has been corrected. (AD-7901)\nLabor Scheduler: Multiple work requests were incorrectly listed under the same time slot. This has been corrected. (AD-13039)\nWork Request Sync table. The step_user_name field was the only field in the wr_sync table that had a security group set for it.\u00a0This was causing syncing\nissues with the Maintenance mobile app under certain circumstances. In the schema, we have removed the security group from this field. (AD-12866)\nChanges in Risk\nEmergency Preparedness. View Egress and Occupancy Plans. This view (ab-egress-occ-plans.axvw) now correctly includes employee names, as it had in\nthe past. (AD-11841)\nCompliance. Operational Reports. Permits and Licenses. (ab-comp-rpt-permit.axvw) Previously, the filter in this view was not working. This has been\ncorrected. (AD-12361)\nChanges in Workplace Services\nReservations\nDefine Room Arrangements. Groups Allowed to Approve. Previously, Groups Allowed to Approve field was limited to only Groups assigned the non-SaaS\nAbWorkplaceReservations application Approve process. It now includes theAbCloudWorkplaceServices process. (AD-8977)\nRecurring Conference Call Reservations. Canceling. If you canceled one reservation of a series of recurring reservations and entered a comment, the\ncomment was applied to all remaining reservations that have the same res_conference value as the canceled reservation. This has been corrected. (AD-11054)\nReports. Filters. For several reports, we fixed the filters that were not properly functioning. (AD-13158, AD-13160, AD-13229).\nExchange Integration. New Application Parameter. To support meetings created by Exchange users that don\u2019t exist in Archibus, the calendar monitoring now\nmaps unknown email addresses to a \u2018dummy\u2019 user via a new application parameter: AbWorkplaceReservations.ExternalBookingEmployeeId. (AD-\n12335)\nExchange Integration. Private Flag. Previously, the private flag was not propagated to Exchange and comments for private meetings were still visible. This has\nbeen corrected. (AD-12868)\nReservations Plugin for Outlook. Recurring Reservation. A problem with the reservation failing when you create a recurring reservation with an exact date\nhas been resolved. (AD-12689)\nReservations Plugin for Outlook. SSO. We have improved SSO experience so that the Outlook user does not access the Web Central application. After a\nsingle login, the user accesses the Archibus Room Finder in Outlook. (AD-12918)\nHoteling.\nWorkplace Utilization. We have improved the filter and added a chart to this view. (AD-12512)\nService Desk\nMove Requests. Email notification. When a move is requested and Request Type is SERVICE DESK - INDIVIDUAL MOVE, we now prevent a move\nnotification email from going out to the department contact, if department contact is the same as the requestor. This change reduces the number of duplicate\nmessages sent. (AD-13083)\nArchibus\u00a0Help known limitations\nNon-English help from the Navigator. If you use the right-click Help command on a Navigator process, you will receive an error message that the topic cannot\nbe found. This is because the localized version of Archibus Help does not contain topics at this level of detail. In a future release, the right-click Help command\nwill load the appropriate topic from the English version of Archibus Help. (AD-2786)\nArchibus SaaS known limitations\nHome Page Publishing. SaaS Partner Administrator. If you sign in as a SaaS Partner Administrator (such as sample user AFM-BP), run the System / SaaS\nPartner Administrator / Manage Home Pages and Processes task, modify a home page, and publish your changes; you receive an error message. As a\nworkaround: use System / Add-In Manager / Publish Home Pages by Role to publish home pages after modifying them. (APP-6426)\nNavigator for AFM-MOD Sample User. If you sign in to the HQ sample project as AFM-MOD, you will notice that the Navigator groups modules into domains\n(including the Archibus SaaS domain) so that the Navigator presents four levels. Having some modules grouped under the Archibus SaaS domain may be\nconfusing if you are demonstrating or learning the product. This change is a result of the Healthcare module being added to the Navigator and the Navigator now\nexceeding 13 modules. This can be resolved by removing a module that you do not need. (AD-12985)\nOnSite mobile app known limitations\nAndroid. Accessing Documents. If you attempt to open a DOCX file linked to a work request on an Android phone, you receive an error message. This is a\nresult of the phone not having an app to open DOCX files. You can install an app for this purpose. (ON-1495)\nNotifications. Chinese. Push notifications are not yet supported for Chinese. (ON-1058)\nNotifications. Oracle. With an Oracle deployment, you cannot receive notification from OnSite; if you check the Web Central Notifications Log view, you will not\nsee any messages sent from OnSite. (ON-1237)\n\nNew Requests. Cannot See. After you create a new request, you may not see it in the Request List because it is added to the end of the request list. You can\nuse the pull-to-refresh feature to re-sort the requests according to the \u201corder by\u201d option.(ON-487)\nWork Request List. Updating. When you create a new request, it is added to the bottom of the list because the sort order of work requests is not updating to\nreflect a new request. Pulling to refresh solves this issue.(ON-723)\nWorkplace known limitations\nAccessibility Mode. Workspace Bookings. In Accessibility Mode, Workplace conveys that a room is unavailable when, in fact, it is available for booking. (AD-\n13569)\nLocalized New V.2023.02 Strings. With a non-English locale, new V.2023.02 user interface elements will appear in English while the rest of the user interface\nwill appear in the user's selected locale. When the localized strings become available, we will post them on Allbound. (AD-13591)\nSearch. When focus is on the filter panel, it should remain on the panel until the user tabs. Instead, when the search is completed, focus shifts automatically to\nthe floor plan. (AD-13716)\nSign in. SSO. If you have set up Web Central for request header SSO in Web Central and enabled UseSingleSessionForConcurrentUsers in\nsecurity.properties, if you attempt to access [WEB CENTRAL URL]/archibus/workplace/ directly, you are not able to log in. You must first access Web\nCentral and then load Workplace from there. Similarly, if you load Workplace, copy the URL, close the browser without signing out, open a new browser and\npaste the URL, you will not be able to log in. (AD-11342, AD-12854)\nMaintenance Requests. Comments. If a work request has a very large file attached, you cannot save a comment that you enter. This happens only for work\nrequests with large file attachments. (AD-11360)\nTablet. iPad Pro. People & Places. UI. The email address in the right panel is not properly displayed. (AD-9466)\nTablet. iPad pro/Safari. SSO If you start Workplace in a Safari browser and without signing out, you close the web browser window fully and then reopen the\nweb browser window and attempt to navigate to Workplace again, you will not be able to start Workplace. To work around the issue, clear the browser cache and\nreopen the browser. Or, open the browser, close the Workplace tab which is stuck, open a new tab and enter a Web Central or Workplace URL. This was tested\non iOS 16.2. (AD-12878)\nTablet. iPad pro/Safari. The header is truncated, and on some pages cuts off buttons. This occurs in both landscape and portrait modes. (AD-13718)\nTablet. Android. Next button. The Next button does not display for several Service Request types when you are running the Workplace mobile app on a tablet.\n(AD-12544)\nTablet. Android. Create Request. Next Button. If you run the Workplace mobile app on an Android tablet, you will find that if the selected request type presents\na questionnaire for you to answer as part of entering the request, Workplace will not display a Next button and you cannot continue with the request. (AD-12848)\nDesk Bookings (Hotelable Rooms)\nTeam Restriction. When the \u201cteam\u201d restriction is defined, and the space selected for booking is assigned to a specific team, the occupants selection list should\nbe restricted to that team. Instead, the occupant list is not restricted to the team. (AD-11906)\nMeeting Room Reservations\nMeeting Times. When you enter time in your search for meeting rooms, and click Book from the list of available rooms, the specified time is not highlighted in\nthe time slider or entered in the start time/duration selectors. (AD-13581)\nSelf-booking. QR\u00a0Codes. When self-booking a meeting room is not permitted (SelfServiceBookMeetingSpace = 0, KioskBookMeetingSpace = 0),\nyou will find that after scanning the QR code label, the Book button is displayed. It should be hidden based on the parameter settings. (AD-9683)\nMultiple Room Configurations. In Workplace, we assume that only one configuration and one room arrangement has been defined for a room. If you create\nmultiple room configurations with the Reservations application, the configurations will appear in Workplace, but there is no distinguishing information about the\nconfigurations and the user will not know which space they are reserving. There will also appear to be a discrepancy between the available room count and the\nnumber of rooms shown on the floor plan. (AD-835, APP-5194, APP-5845)\nRecurrence Pattern. Workspace reservations do not show recurrence patterns in the details view. You can only delete a single occurrence at a time. AD-835)\nTime Slots. Meeting space requests do not honor the value of the parameter in AbWorkplaceReservations-MinutesTimeUnit. You can only select time\nintervals in 30-minute blocks. (AD-7010)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nService Request. Uploading Both Images and Documents. Due to device and application permissions, it is not possible to upload both camera images and\nother file types from the device in the same service request. (AD-13309, AD-13928)\nScrolling and extra spaces. There are improper empty spaces above the header and below the footer. There are two redundant scroll bars that appear when it\nis impossible to scroll up or scroll down. (AD-13929)\nQR scan. Android Tablet. When applied in a mobile browser, the URL generated by a room correctly takes the user to the Room booking view. However, in the\nWorkplace Mobile app running on an Android tablet, the URL generated by the room QR scan incorrectly takes you to Workplace Dashboard view. (AD-13986)\nQR Codes. The Home button is not available after scanning a QR code, and from QR Code page, it is difficult to navigate to the login screen. (AD-9659, AD-9681)\nSigning in. Android. Mobile Client version. You cannot log in if you are not using Mobile Client 4.0. As a workaround, upgrade to Mobile Client 4.0. (AD-6801)\nSelect Occupants for Workspace Booking. If you try to book six or more staff for working space, the UI cannot correctly display you selected employees. (AD-\n8599)\nWeb Central known limitations\nLocalized New V.2023.02 Strings. With a non-English locale, new V.2023.02 Web Central and Workplace user interface elements will appear in English while\nthe rest of the user interface will appear in the user's selected locale. The localized strings will be available in the future. (AD-13591)\nBIM\u00a0Viewer.\nLocalized. In localized versions of Archibus, you will find that the tooltips on the Autodesk Forge toolbar are not localized. (AD-12210)\nBlank Worksheets. For some Revit 2022 models, the new feature \u201cSheets & Views\u201d may display the worksheets as blank. This is an issue with the\nAutodesk Platform Services API that we could not fix on our side and we are waiting for Autodesk to fix. (AD-10801)\nSelect Values. Floors. For 2.0 views that have a filter that includes the Floor Code field, the view may not show all available floors. The root cause is that the\ncore UI grid control determines the number of pages based on the number of index records. For the Floor selector, the index uses the Building Code, i.e. there\nare 111 buildings with floors. Thus, the grid shows only two pages of floor records (one page = 100 records). (AD-3706)\nMenu options hidden. When a view title is too long, the top menu actions (User Menu, User Help, Add to Favorites) and client logo are not visible. (AD-4820)\nNavigator. Non-English Locale. If you launch Web Central from the Smart Client and are using a non-English locale, the Web Central Navigator will not display\nyour applications and tasks. (AD-3866)\nPolish characters in V.25.x and later user interface. With the V.25.1 user interface refresh, special characters in UI titles translated to Polish do not appear like\nthe other characters. For customers who have this issue, we recommend modifying all CSS files in the \\schema\\ab-core\\views\\navigator folder to replace this\nline: font-family: \"Open Sans\";\nwith this line: font-family: \"Open Sans\", Arial; (AD-2292)\nQuestionnaires. Non-English. Questionnaires, such as those in Condition Assessment and Sustainability Assessment, do not allow assessors to edit out-of-\nthe-box, sample questions that have been localized from English (US) to other languages. The workaround is for Archibus Administrators to use Archibus Smart\nClient to edit the text of these sample questions. This issue affects only sample data questionnaires that have been localized from English. (AD-1547)\nExtended Questionnaires. Document/Photo. The Web Central questionnaire form (for both Compliance and Maintenance) does not currently support\nrespondent-initiated submission of more than one document/photo attachment per question, whether or not the questionnaire designer specifies a value greater\n\nthan 1 for Maximum Number Responses. The mobile app does support this feature. You cannot delete the uploaded document after Save the question-answer;\nthere is no action when clicking the X button. A questionnaire designer should take this into account when designing forms. (APP-2426, AD-4431)\nIf the intended respondents will be using Web Central to submit documents and flexibility in number of document responses is desired, then the designer\ncan work around the limitation by defining a parent question containing a follow-up question of type document and allow multiple instances of the parent\nquestion.\nFor example, parent question could be multiple choice \"attach a document?\" Yes/No. If Yes, then the application shows the document question as a\nfollow-up. Set up the \"Attach a document\" question to allow multiple answers, such that the respondent can add another, answer \"Yes\" and so on.\nHome Page Editor. Maps. When creating home pages, you add only one map bucket to each home page. (WC-2790)\nHome Pages. Localized. For some international users, home pages may display English titles for columns in the Metric Trends panel. If this issue occurs, the\nuser can switch to a different home page and go back, or sign out and sign in again. (WC-2373)\nGrid. Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) fields. If working with a view in which you define highlight patterns (such as Space / Space Inventory / Background\nData / Define Division and Department Highlight Patterns, ab-sp-create-dp-hatch.axvw), and you set a gradient highlight, create a swatch bitmap, and refresh the\nview, the Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) field will not correctly show the swatch bitmap for the gradient highlight. Instead, the fields show the same color for all\ngradient highlight definitions. (WC-2748)\nGrid 3.0. Grid Control 3.0, which is used in views such as PM Planner (ab-pm-planner.axvw) and Service Console (ab-request-console.axvw), presents an error\nif you try to sort by a field that is not from the main table. (AD-8474)\nSchema Change Wizard. Oracle. When using Schema Change Wizard on an Oracle database, you may face the error ORA-01031: insufficient privileges when\nchoosing to re-create any of the Archibus security tables: afm_users; afm_groups. Resolution: Choose \"Alter existing table structures (preserves additional\nfields)\" option when trying to update afm_users/afm_groups tables. (3045736)\nSmart Client known limitations\nNavigator. With a non-SaaS license, logging in to the Smart Client as AFM incorrectly produces a Navigator that includes an Archibus SaaS process. (AD-3794)\nSAML. Connecting to SAML requires user to make server selection on subsequent sign-ins. (AD-1996)\nCertificate Authentication. Web Central tasks. Cannot data transfer or launch Web Central if Certificate Authentication is in effect. (SMAR-626)\nEditing standards tables. If you edit Furniture Standards or Equipment Standards with the default database, the titles for the Length and Width fields will show\nincorrectly as \"ft\" or \"M\". If you log in with a different locale (e.g. view an Imperial project as a Metric user) the program will convert the values. The condition also\noccurs in Furniture or Equipment Standards views loaded in Web Central. To avoid this condition in both environments, load the Archibus Fields table (afm_flds),\nfind the Length and Width fields, and change their Numeric Format from \"Length\" to \"Default\". (3037311)\nDeleting a record with a date/time field as part of its primary key. You are unable to delete records from tables that have a date/time field as part of the\nprimary key, such as the ehs_medical_mon_results table. There are no such errors when deleting records from the same table in Web Central views. (WC-2169)\nDeleting. hwr and hwo tables. It is not possible to delete records from Smart Client grid views that present these tables. As a work-around, delete the records\nfrom Web Central. (SMAR-596)\nDeleting. Bulk Editing. Currently there is no way of bulk deleting data from Smart Client. If you select all records and then hit Delete, only those records\ncurrently displayed on screen are deleted; all of the other records that are selected but not on screen remain. As a work-around, in View Definition Wizard, create\na single panel interactive report for the table in question, choose only the primary key field(s) unless you need to add a restriction. In the preview pane, enable\nadvanced editing, and add multipleSelectionEnabled=\u201dtrue\u201d in the panel, then insert a panel action with a command type deleteSeletedRows.\nSave Changes and preview the view and you can check all and delete right from the preview, without needing to save/publish it. (SMAR-17)\nRibbon. The Smart Client ribbon is very small on high resolution monitors. (SMAR-503)\nGrid. Refresh when filtering. After you set and clear a filter, the grid does not correctly update record counts and refresh. As a workaround, run the Clear action\non the menu ribbon. (SMAR-609)\nReplace Column. When there are more than two tables in the standard role attached to the Smart Client grid view, the command presents errors. (SMAR-528)\nModified views cannot be saved as default view. Log in as a user that has the Security group SYS-VIEW-ALTER (such as AFMX), open a view, change the\nview, save, and make it the default view. Reload, and the default view will not reflect your changes. (SMAR-329)\nExplorer pane. Recent Views list. When you create new views and save them in the Explorer's list of recent views, you can save up to 8 views. When you save\nthe ninth view, the system removes the newest view from the list. It should remove the oldest view from the list. (SMAR-907)\nData Transfer. Dates deleted from the output file are not cleared in the database after transferring in the file with the changes made. (SMAR-671)\nSmart Client Extension for AutoCAD\u00a0known limitations\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nQuery Table. The Query Table command does not include fields that contribute to the primary key; for example, it does not show the Building Code and Floor\nCode values for rooms. (SMAR- 798)\nHighlighting commands\nUnclosed polylines. If some areas don't highlight with solid highlights, they might be open not closed polylines. If so, close them. The AutoCAD solids\ndon't fill unclosed-closed polylines. AutoCAD hatch patterns do, however. Notice that if you have multiple areas of one type (e.g. Office standard), having\none unclosed polyline may cause others to also not have a solid fill (since Archibus hatches many of them in one go for efficiency's sake). (3030818)\nHatch patterns. The Archibus-defined patterns (from the .pat file) are not being loaded into AutoCAD at the time of highlighting. Only the out-of-the-box\nAutoCAD patterns work as expected because the highlighting logic defaults to a SOLID hatch pattern if it can't find the pattern definition. (SMAR-902)\nLarge floor plans. When dealing with very large floor plans (3,500 rooms on a single floor), commands like Catalog Layer and Highlight by Department do not\ngive progress feedback, but function correctly.\nAsset Text Height. The Smart Client Extension ignores the atxt_ht_in and atxt_ht_cm in favor of the atxt_ht value, which is in inches. For metric drawings the\nSCE converts this to cm. (SMAR-189)\nEdit Data. Suite areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0.\nIf you press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nTrial layers. Asset text. Asset text is left-justified instead of center-justified. (SMAR-492)\nExplorer window. Anchoring. When you open a drawing from within the Smart Client drawings list, the Explorer window should be positioned according to the\nsettings made in the previous session; instead, it opens in the floating position and you must reset it. (SMAR-702)\nDrawing Publishing\u00a0\nAutoCAD Leader objects. EMF does not support arrows or text with the leaders. SVG supports only solid arrows. (3044919)\nSecondary circulation areas as regions. As documented in\nhttps://www.archibus.net/ai/abizfiles/v23_help/archibus_help/user_en/archibus.htm#../Subsystems/webc/Content/web_user/space/concepts/open_plan.htm,\nyou can draw accurate polylines for secondary circulation using AutoCAD REGIONS. Publishing these drawings may result in rooms being set incorrectly\nin front of or behind other rooms. In order for rooms within a secondary circulation region to be shown and highlighted in front of the secondary circulation\nspace in a published drawing, they must be numbered higher than the secondary circulation space. (3051186)\nXREF The XREF Layer does not publish when the TURNOFFALL* value is specified in the additional layers field. As a workaround, turn off layers\nindividually and do not use the TURNOFFALL* feature to control XREF Layers.(SMAR-1001)\nAFM_NET_LISP \"Publish\" command. Ignores the viewWindow attribute when the publishType is EMF and the generated file is published to extents.\n(SMAR-737).\nSVG. Background Color. If you set the Set the ColorMapping field to BLACK for AbPubBackground in the sample HQ database and publish, the black\nbackground does not appear to take effect. This is because there are multiple active rules in the database, and later results overwrite the earlier ones. To\nresolve this either (a) set the Active flag to No for all of the SVG files except for one; or, (b) specify a unique Rule Suffix (e.g. -bl, -reg, -eq) for each rule,\nexcept for the one that has a Color Mapping value so that different rules will produce different output files. (SMAR-417)\nSVG. Hatches. Complex hatches, meaning that there are multiple polylines that are used as the boundaries for the hatch, do not publish to SVG; whereas\nhatches that do successfully publish are contained in a single polyline. You can separate the hatches using HATCHEDIT, and the publishing will work as\nexpected. (SMAR-513)\n\nRefreshing. Firefox. If your workstation uses Firefox and you load a drawing's enterprise graphics in Web Central or in the Smart Client, then republish\nthat drawing's enterprise graphics, the change may not appear when you reload the view with the enterprise graphics. For performance reasons, some\nversions of Firefox do not immediately refresh the enterprise graphics files from their local cache even when the file has a later time stamp, as checking\nthe time stamp involves an extra query to the server for each file. To view your changes, clear your cache or restart your browser. If you wish to see\nchanges immediately without clearing your cache, you can change your browser cache settings to control the problem.\n1. In Firefox's menu, select Tools >\u00a0Options.\n2. Select the Advanced tab, and then the Network tab.\n3. In the Offline Storage section, enter 0 for the MB of space used for the cache.(3024655)\nSmart Client Extension for Revit known limitations\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nUncatalog. With Revit 2022 running on Windows 11, you cannot select Asset Type on the Uncatalog form. (AD-10027)\nNames of models and levels. Currently, the Smart Client Extension for Revit does not support model names or level names containing the '-' character.(AD-9418)\nFile names with special characters. When you publish a Revit file whose file name contains spaces and characters such as #+\u00b0$(), you may receive an error\nmessage when viewing the SVG file in Web Central. (WC-3132)\nOpening a model. Error message. Due to the way that Updater classes are implemented, Revit presents a message that you are missing a third-party updater.\nYou can ignore this message. (SMAR-974).\nNumber.\nIf you Number a room and then use the Smart Client to show the Room field \"Perimeter ft\u201d, the perimeter shows as 0. If you Data Edit or Data Edit\nMultiple, the number is corrected. (SMAR-285)\nIf the database does not contain enough information for the Number command to execute, it fails to number instead of providing feedback to the user\nabout what database information is needed to successfully run the command. (SMAR-526)\nDeleting rooms. Revit does not notify Archibus when Revit deletes rooms. Currently, Archibus cannot uncatalog rooms on that event. Use the Synchronization /\nUncatalog Records without Assets command to clear the Drawing Name and Id fields on these rooms in one step.\nWeb Query. If the last primary key value for an asset is a single digit (e.g. if you query for room \"1\"), then the pop up dialog results are not restricted to that one\nrecord. This doesn't occur for two- and three-digit IDs (e.g. room \"10\" or \"100\"). (3035367, 3035366, 3034950, 3034414)\nPublish Enterprise Graphics. Colors. Since Revit floor plans do not have color, colors for Enterprise Graphics generated from Revit can cause confusion,\nespecially since the user does not have control over this. In a future release, Archibus will address this issue. (SMAR-988)\nEdit Data\u00a0\nRooms. Some objects in linked models are not correctly picking up room codes of the rooms they are inside of. (SMAR-785)\nGroup Areas. For new groups, the Group Code will show as \"1\" until the record is actually saved. Thereafter, the proper autonumbered ID will show.\n(3034828)\nSuite Areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0. If\nyou press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nLong parameter values. If you have a parameter value (e.g. Name) mapped to an Archibus field (e.g. Option 1), and that parameter has an existing\nvalue longer than the field width in Archibus, then you will not be able to create a record using Edit Data. You can shorten the parameter value using the\nRevit Parameters dialog. Alternately, if you use the Archibus Catalog command, the command will find all of these conditions and allow you to rectify them\nindividually or in groups. (3034793)\nMap Database Fields. This form is empty if there are no assets in the model of the specified asset type. (3034357)\nCopy / Paste. If you copy and paste furniture and equipment, you also copy and paste their Revit properties. Use the Archibus synchronization commands to\nfind and resolve any duplicates. (3030989)\nOutlook Plugin known limitations\nRegistry Entry to Keep Enabled. To ensure the Plugin cannot be disabled by users and will not be disabled automatically by Outlook, you must replace the\nfollowing DWORD registry value (which is added by the standard installer)\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=dword:1\nwith a string value.\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=\"1\"\nThis replacement can be implemented by customizing the Outlook Plugin MSI installer with a customization tool such as Master Packager. (AD-10391)\nSystem Administration known limitations\nSecurity. LDAP. The result of using a distinguished name with a comma results in this error in archibus.log: \"LDAP: error code 49 - Invalid Credentials\". The\nsolution is to change the bind user's \"CN=\" value to a name that does not contain a comma. (3037258)\nSecurity. SSO. In SSO mode, when the user name is incorrect, the user is redirected to the timeout page instead of the SSO error page. (WC-2027)\nIofT. Oracle. The Technologies / Innovative Solutions /Integrations - IoT / IoT Space Utilization view is not Oracle-compatible. (AD-8296)\nSolution Templates. Calendar Control. The Reservations Calendar example records multiple days for one-day events. (WC-3237)\nConnectListener. When ConnectListener runs, it does not move the previous afm_conn_log entries to afm_conn_logh. (AD-7003)\nSchema Change Wizard. The archibus.log fails to show correctly field and table name in the global dataset. This is only a logging issue. There is no functional\nerror. (3033565)\nGrid. API. Grid panels can display custom values calculated in Java Script code. An example can be seen in the following view. This example displays the\ncustom Location field that is composed from Building, Floor, Room, and Location database fields. The example also includes a menu that allows the user to\nproduce reports with the grid data. Due to Web Central technical implementation limitation, custom values formatted in Java Script code cannot be displayed in\nthese reports. (3041685)\nPath: Technologies / User Interface Add-Ins / Assemblies with Multiple Panels / Find-Manage with Categories\nFile: ab-products\\solutions\\assemblies\\work-wizard\\ab-ex-work-wizard.js\nFunction: updateLocations()\nGrid. API. When designing views with a grid panel, you cannot set specific grid column width in pixels. The grid automatically sets column widths according to\nthe available space and the data displayed in each column. (3045398)\nGrid. API. The Clear Filter icon is not visible if the last grid column is hidden. To avoid the issue, add an empty last column. The condition does not affect any of\nthe Archibus applications. (3040363)\nDatabase known limitations\nDatabase Update Wizard. runDuw.sql script. The Database Update Wizard generates an SQL script called runDuw.sql. When writing this file, it does not\nreplace macros with SQL. (AD-10595)\n\nMobile Framework known limitations\nFail to log in again when reloading mobile client. iOS. If you log in, close mobile client, and then attempt to log in again, you will find that you cannot log in.\nThe failure stems from being already logged into the OIDC connector and trying to reestablish a session. IOS has not been fully upgraded for service workers\ndue to extra restrictions service workers have in IOS Safari. Therefore IOS still requires the connection checks. A workaround is to wait until the OIDC session is\ninvalid/logged out, as well as not selecting \"remember me\" (for example in Okta) while on IOS. Not closing the app while there is a valid session will avoid this\nissue entirely. This is not an issue for Android. (AD-6517)\nSurveys. Measurement questions. Android. With the survey (questionnaire) features in both Maintenance and Compliance Surveys mobile apps, users can\nenter non-numeric values for Measurement questions. These values do not correctly upload when the mobile apps are synced. A future version will add\nvalidation so that users can input only numbers as the answer of Measurement type questions. (AD-4600)\nMobile App known limitations\nCompliance Surveys. Questionnaires. If a questionnaire requires a service request and the service request is created and then deleted, the questionnaire will\nstill indicate the service request step is complete. (AD-9047)\nMaintenance. Resources. If you add resources, such as parts, tools, and costs, you will not see the new resource records in both Resource Details form. Thus,\nyou might think the resource records were not added. After syncing, you will see that the resource record were successfully added. (AD-5908)\nMaintenance.uniqueidentifier Error. Due to Archibus resetting an application parameter for use with OnSite, users of the Maintenance mobile app will\nencounter the \"uniqueidentifier property to be defined\" error after completing a checklist or refreshing the screen. To resolve this, run System / Archibus\nAdministrator - Application Configuration / Configure Application Parameters and reset the AbCommonResources.MobileSyncDataChangesOnlyTables\napplication parameter to: bl;eq;rm;rmpct;dv;dp;fl;em;pt_store_loc_pt. (AD-11666, AD-11679)\nMaintenance. Checklists. Android 11. If you try to create a request from a work request's checklist, you receive a blank screen. This occurs only on Android 11.\n(AD-5863)\nMaintenance. Stopping Work. Supervisors cannot stop a work request that has a pending checklist. (AD-4883)\nMaintenance. Reopening a Checklist when Verifying It. If a supervisor reopens a checklist during the verify process, the work request correctly moves back to\nthe Issued status. If this work request's checklist is still pending and the supervisor or craftsperson now selects multiple work requests to complete (including this\none), you will find that you can complete this work request despite the fact that it has an open checklist. The issue does not occur when working from the My\nWork form because the form does not support multi-select action. (AD-4882)\nMaintenance. Confirmation. SLAs can contain Confirmation steps on the \"Issued\" and \"Completed\" statuses. Users who are assigned to these steps can\nperform the confirmation (Approve/Reject/Cancel) in the Maintenance Console, but this feature is not supported in the mobile Maintenance app. Confirmation\nsteps work only on the \"Requested\" and \"Assigned to Work Order\" statuses on mobile. (AD-7267)\nMaintenance. Sync Issues.\nWhen a user performs a Sync action on the mobile Maintenance app, any craftspersons hours data (such as Actual Hours or Overtime Hours) can be\noverwritten if those hours were entered in Web Central. (3045897)\nWhen a requestor reports multiple maintenance requests of the same type from different locations and then syncs to upload all the requests at once, the\nmobile app does not consistently upload all the requests. To avoid this problem, sync after entering each request. (3048805).\nPart quantities are synced on the mobile Maintenance app only when you sync the background data. This affects mobile users who perform any of the\nfollowing actions on the mobile maintenance application:\no Estimate parts on a work request\no Add purchased parts to inventory\no Complete a work request that includes parts\nAfter you perform any of these actions and sync, the system will update the part quantities correctly in the database and they will appear correctly in Web\nCentral; however, the mobile application will not show these new quantities. Also, any changes made by other mobile users or Web Central users to the\npart quantities will not be synced. The workaround is to go the Sync settings on the mobile application and click the button that says \u201cReset Background\nData Sync Flag\u201d. When you return to the Maintenance application, the background data will automatically sync, and the part quantities will be updated on\nthe device. (3053237)\nMaintenance. Seeing Rejected Requests. Approvers can reject requests back to the requestor or step completer. However, mobile users cannot see or\nresubmit those rejected requests from the mobile application. This must be done from the Building Operations Console.(3048370)\nMaintenance. Photos. You can request maintenance from the Workplace Services Portal app and the Maintenance app, and you can update maintenance\nrequests from the Maintenance app. However, the two apps store maintenance photos in different tables (wr and activity_log), which can cause problems when\nediting or deleting a photo. When you request maintenance using the Workplace Services Portal app and add a photo, and then access the corresponding work\nrequest using the Maintenance app, the photo will be shown. However, if later the photo is deleted by the Maintenance team from the work request (wr) record,\nthe photo will not be deleted from the activity_log record, and vice versa. There are several alternative scenarios for adding, changing, or deleting photos which\nmay cause this kind of issue. This issue will be fixed in a future release. (3047423)\nWorkplace Portal. Chinese. If you enter a space after a Building Code value, you will encounter an error with Rooms / Locate Employee. (AD-5913)\nWorkplace Services known limitations\nService Desk known limitations\nManage Request Types. Non-English Locale. When using the Service Desk / Service Desk Manager / Manage Request Types view (ab-create-activitytype-\ntabs.axvw) to edit request types that have been translated into other locales, the request type does not appear correctly in Service Desk Manager edit form. (AD-\n2813)\nReservations known limitations\nArchibus Extension for Exchange Integration. Reservation with No Subject. If you create a reservation with no subject, the message stays in the user's\ncalendar and the reservation cannot be found in Archibus; the reservation errors out in the log because the subject is empty. (AD-13528)\nReservations Calendar Console. Attendees in Room. Does not correctly set the \u201cAttendees in Room\u201d field value when creating meetings; there is no way for\na user to manually edit this value. (AD-4856)\nReservations Calendar Console. Double-byte Characters and Comments Field. The Calendar Console presents an error message when you attempt to\nconfirm a reservation whose comment includes double-byte characters and is larger than 4000 characters. As a workaround, enter smaller comments when a\ncomment includes double-byte characters. (AD-436)\nReservations Calendar Console. Recurring Reservations for Monthly Meetings. The timeline does not always correctly display recurring patterns for\nmonthly meetings. For example, if you created a reservation for the first Monday of the month, the Reservations Calendar Console might show all Mondays in\nthe month. Although the timeline might not display these reservations correctly, the Console does correctly save these meeting dates and the summary text\nreflects the proper date. (APP-6651)(AD-1028)\nReservations Calendar Console. Room Configurations. For situations in which multiple reservations exist at the same time in the same room, but for different\nroom configurations, the calendar displays only one reservation. (APP-6561)\nReservations Calendar Console. Continuous Meetings. The system does not prompt you resolve continuous meetings that have conflicts; when it encounters\nthis situation, the system generates a workflow rule error. (APP-6535)\nReservations Calendar Console. Conference Calls.\nIf you create a conference call and you select several buildings in order to select rooms in several buildings; and if many of the rooms in one building are\nreservable, all of the rooms for this building are shown, and reservable rooms from other buildings are not displayed. This can make hard to select rooms\nfrom different buildings. The TimelineMaxRoomsPerBuilding application parameter does not control this.(APP-6214)\nYou cannot edit the date and time of a conference call reservation. (APP-6613)\nReservations Calendar Console. Changing Room Selection.Time not Recorded. If you select a room, select a time, add some resources, and select\nanother room; you will find that the designated time does not persist to the second room. (APP-6800)\nReservations Calendar Console. Application Parameters. The TimelineStartTime and TimelineEndTime parameters work only with one-hour\nincrements. If you enter times such as 9:30 and 17:30 in the parameters, the Calendar Console does not consider them. (APP-6698)\nCreate Resource Reservation. Reservation Timeline. Microsoft Surface. You cannot drag with touch input a reservation on the timeline. Timeline drag-and-\ndrop supports only mouse events. (APP-3312)\n\nOutlook Plugin. My Reservations. When the Outlook Plugin displays the My Reservations, the popup is opened without the option to edit any of the\nreservations showed, so users cannot add resources. The Add Reservation button is also disabled. (AD-4846)\nGoogle Calendar Integration. When you have configured the application for \"no integration\" with Exchange, the .ics files that are generated to be imported into\nOutlook, Google Calendar, or any other calendar app, sometimes do not correctly update the Google Calendar application. Specifically, there can be a problem\nwith the file content related to the meeting identifiers created by the application. These meeting identifiers are not always unique. If you create a new calendar,\ninstead of importing an existing one, the creation of meetings seems to work correctly for single and recurring reservations, but updates and cancellations don\u2019t\nalways work as expected.\nSpace known limitations\nView and Print Floor Plan. If Room Category and Room Type have the same value, only one value is displayed in the drawing. (AD-10178)\nSpace Console. Highlights. Highlights that combine Teams and Divisions or Teams and Departments do not work in v2023.02. We will be working on this for\nv2023.03. (AD-14040)\nSpace Console. Export to DOCX or Excel. Currently the Export feature is not exporting all records listed in the tabs (Room Categories, Employees, Rooms,\nand so on) to XLS or DOCX. tab. For Excel, you can export only 100 records; for DOCX, the amount varies. As a work-around, export from other views. (AD-13752,\nAD-13368)\nSpace Console. Export What You See. If you select multiple floor plans to display, only the first displayed floor plan is exported. All visible floor plans should\nexport. (AD-12658)\nSpace Console. Search by Team. If you select Show Teams in View Settings, use the Advanced Search form to search for a team, floor plans that have\nassigned teams do not show. However, you can load these floor plans if you select them from the floor list. (AD-12821)\nSpace Console. Search. Default Layers. If you search for a floor using the Smart Search Bar and load the floor plan, the default layers correctly display.\nHowever, if you choose another floor plan from the search results, the not all the default layers display on the second floor plan. (AD-9538)\nSpace Console. Bulk Editing Rooms. If you select from the floor plan more than 10 rooms and attempt to bulk-edit them, the form may not display all the fields\nand buttons making it difficult or impossible to edit the selected rooms. When editing rooms in bulk, edit fewer than 10 rooms at one time. (AD-2711)\nSpace Console. Generate Ad Hoc PDF. Large Drawings. For large drawings, such as one with an SVG size of 5590K, the report may not generate. In these\ncases, increase the memory, such as increasing the Tomcat memory to 2048 M. (AD-2048)\nSpace Console. Employees Tab. Selecting Employees. If you have a list of employees that runs over multiple pages, when you select employees and then\nmove to \"Next\" or \"Previous\" page, the selection will be cleared. As a workaround, you can first use the \"Place Employee in Waiting Room\" or \"Unassign\" action\nfor the selected employees on the current page, and then move to a different page to select additional employees. (AD-2741)\nSpace Console. Team Space. Organization Name Field. When assigning associations to teams, you will see that the Associations tab includes the\nOrganization Name field. This is validated by the Organizational Units (org) table. To create the values for the Organizational Units table so that they are\navailable when completing the Organization Name field, you must use the Smart Client. Create a new view that holds the org table and use this view to define\nyour organizational units. (3052882)\nSpace Console. Plan Types. Using Plan Types on the Space Console affords the user the ability to personalize highlights, text labels, and printed legends to\nthe deployment's needs, in addition to the pre-existing highlights and label options that exist on the Space Console's drop-down menus. The Add-In Manager\ndefines Plan Type highlights and labels by creating or modifying view files and datasources that are logged in the active_plantypes table. However, to make\nchanges or add legend datasources, in addition to defining those datasources in the view file that active_plantypes references, the Add-In manager must:\n1. Make an associated change in the same view file for a highlight datasource, and name it as the legend is named. For example, if the Add-In Manager\nmakes a legend datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend\", they must also make an associated highlight datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-\nhl-rm-by-dp-name_rmHighlight\".\n2. In the PDF export AXVW file ab-sp-console-export-drawing-pdf.axvw, the Add-in Manager must also create a legend-type panel and refer to the\nnew legend datasource. Following the same example, the panel's id must be named panel_ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend, and the\ndatasource must equal ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend. The fields that the datasource defines and that should be visible in the legend must\nbe defined in that panel. (3050005)\nSpace Requests. Moves. If you change the From Location in a space request, use Space / Moves / Move Coordinator / Complete Group Moves to close the\nmove, and check the rmpct record, you will see that the value for primary_em is still 0. It should change to 1 since user has changed the From Location from\nsatellite location to primary location. The conditions for this situation are: workspace transactions are enabled, the SLA for Group Move calls for the service\nprovider as Move Management and no approvers, and the application parameters are: InferRoomDepartments=0 and\nAssignUnallocatedSpace=ProrateFloor. (3043629)\nMoves. Action Questionnaires. If you add new Action Types (using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Types task), you cannot add\nquestionnaires to these new action types using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Questionnaires task. (3028382)\nMaintenance known limitations\nNon-English Locales. Tagging in Comments. When you tag someone in a comment using OnSite or Web Central, the system generates an email; under a\nnon-English locale, the strings in both email title and email body are not translated. Non-translated text includes: the string 'tagged you in work request' in both\nemail title and email body, as well as all the strings for work request parameters in email body. (AD-9394)\nTime Zones. You will encounter the wrong time zone in work orders (11:57 AM instead of 1:57 PM) if you select the \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value as the time zone using\nthe Define Geographical Locations view. Instead, select a city-specific time zone such as \"Europe/Paris timezone(UTC+1)\". The \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value will be\nremoved in the future as it is not necessary. (AD-8802)\nMaintenance Console. Sorting. The first time that you sort the Maintenance Console's grid by a field it correctly sorts; if you sort by the same fields multiple\ntimes, the sort does not work and the arrow in the header row does not update correctly. (AD-7932)\nCraftspersons. Notifications. For SLAs that are configured so craftspersons are to be notified when work is issued (notify craftsperson check-box), the\ncraftsperson is not receiving notification when the work is issued. (AD-4960)\nCraftsperson Sample Data. In the sample HQ project, there are many records in Craftspersons (cf) table that do not have email account; also many have\nduplicated email accounts like no-response@archibustgd.com. The key convention for the workflow is: cf.email=em.email=afm_users.email. These\nvalues must be unique. To fix this issue, just remove those records from the cf table for which emails are either empty or have duplicated value. Below are some\nsituations where duplicated values can cause problems\nLaunch SLA console, dispatch to supervisor, click Select Value, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_supervisor=1\nContinue to add a estimation step, select employee to do estimation, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_estimator=1\nLaunch the Maintenance Console, click any work request, click the Forward button, select supervisor, you will see all employees instead of all meeting the\nrestriction: cf.is_supervisor=1.(AD-6744)\nAssets known limitations\nAsset Lifecycle Console. Classification Filter. When you filter for a classification, in the Select Value list associated with the Classification filter, the\nClassifications tree expands automatically up to the second level. The returned classification results may be at lower levels, so you may need to manually\nexpand the tree to see everything. Ideally, the Asset Lifecycle Console would automatically expand to the appropriate level; however, it expands only to the\nsecond level due to potential performance issues on larger inventories of assets. ( AD-10324 )\nAsset Disposal Console. Inventory of Asset Systems report. Oracle only. The Inventory of Asset Systems report (available from the Reports button on the\nAsset Relationship Analysis tab) presents a workflow rule error if you are running on Oracle. (AD-14128)\nAsset Disposal Console. Changing Building Status from Asset Disposal Console Causes Inconsistencies in Real Estate. The Asset Disposal Console\nupdates the asset records for Buildings and Properties as well as inserts OT records to match when the asset is disposed of. REPM reports on Owned, Pipeline,\nand Disposed OT statuses for buildings, but ignores buildings with other ownership transaction statuses, or gives unexpected results in reports. The Real Estate\ndomain's Add/Edit Wizard does not have a way to modify the status of the bl record. Setting the transaction Status to Owner does not change the status of the\nbuilding to Owned. Coordinate OT records with asset status in both Real Estate and Disposal Console. (APP-852)\nDefine Classifications. Deleting Top Levels. In the Define Classification view (ab-ca-def-class.axvw, which is available from the Business Process\nOwner process of Asset Management, Condition Assessment, and Environmental Sustainability Assessment), you cannot delete a top level. Instead, you must\ndelete the top level by using Smart Client and deleting the record from the csi table. If you are not going to use a top-level classification hierarchy, it is advisable\nto delete all the child records (under the top level) before deleting the top level. (AD-6682)\n\nClassifications. Localization. Numeric ID (Automatic Lookup). The Classifications (csi) and Classification Standards (csi_std) tables are not translatable.\nTherefore, in order to use the Automatic Lookups (Numeric IDs) feature for asset classifications, enable Automatic Lookups for them without\nafm_scmpref.preferences. Otherwise, Archibus will look for the translatable fields in the two tables, resulting in application errors. Also, the Asset\nClassification Description field (csi.description) and the field Classification Standard Description (csi_std.description) are not translatable. If enabling\nthe Automatic Lookup for these fields, do not use the attribute displayType=\"translate\" because the fields are not translatable.(APP-4286) (AD-6683).\nEnterprise Assets known limitations\nProject Proposal Console. Baseline cost of a Billion Monetary Units or Greater. If you enter a baseline cost for an individual required asset that is a billion\nmonetary units or greater, you get an error that the value entered exceeds the maximum storage unit for the field. This is because the value for the baseline cost\nin the sb_items table is defined as numeric (9,1). However, the value you entered displays correctly in the grid and in the statistical summary because the value\nin the eq_req_items table is defined as numeric (16,2). This error occurs only in the rare case that the cost of an individual asset is a billion monetary units or\ngreater. (3052851)\nProject Proposal Console. Selected Period Fields not Displaying. The default selection is to display Baseline and Period 1. If you add other period fields but\nthen want to return to the default setting and find that the Console is not displaying your selection, clear your browser cache. (APP-1601)\nManage Reference Documents. This task enables you to associate a document with a Building Use, Property Type, and Furniture Standard. However, there is\ncurrently no way to view documents added for these items. It also enables you to associate a document with projects of different types. Currently, you are able to\nview documents for only projects that have the Scenario type. You are, however, able to view documents added for work request Problem Types, PM\nprocedures, and action items that are associated with a Proposed project. (3050281)\nAsset Portal known limitations\nView Equipment Plan. If you have a lot of asset symbols on the floor plan, they may not display the Equipment Code as asset text and may not be correctly\nfilled with color. (3028852)\nReal Property known limitations\nForecasting known limitations\nPortfolio Forecasting Wizard. Calculations. If the user units are different from the project units, when you calculate the area on the floor for an allocation event\nby multiplying headcount by average area per employee, the result can be off by a factor of 10.76. (3052105)\nStrategic Financial Analysis known limitations\nFinancial Analysis Console. VPA. The console does not load if the user has a VPA that is not compatible with the console restriction. Please see Adding VPA to\nthe Financial Analysis Console \u00a0for details on creating a VPA for this console. (3053673)\nSustainability &\u00a0Risk known limitations\nCompliance known limitations\nExtended Questionnaires. Service Requests from Mobile. Although the ability to create service requests from questionnaires was added to the Compliance\nSurveys mobile app, it has not yet been implemented in the Web Central Compliance application. Therefore, if a mobile questionnaire respondent provides\ndetails for a follow-up Service Request actions for any question in a questionnaire, then the respondent should take care to fully submit the questionnaire via the\nmobile app; they should not edit or submit via the Web Central questionnaire edit form because the Web Central edit form might not preserve the request details\nor set the status of the request as expected via the mobile app. (APP-4250)\nExtended Questionnaires. Assigned to Events. View my Events Calendar. The \"View My Events Calendar\" task for Compliance Program Coordinators does\nnot provide a link from events details to answer or review any questionnaires that might be attached to assigned events. The workaround is for Program\nCoordinators to use one of the other \"My... Events\" tasks to access assigned questionnaires. (APP-1667)\nExtended Questionnaires. Question Tree. Nodes without Child Records. In the Define Compliance Questionnaire view, when you examine a question that\nhas multiple choice answers, you will see that the Question Tree does not indicate that a node has no child content. When a node has no children, it still displays\nthe triangle-shaped icon for expanding and collapsing, giving the impression that there are child records. After you click the node, the triangle disappears until\nrefresh. (WC-2386)\nContracts and Compliance Programs with Cost Records. Deleting. You must first delete all assigned cost records associated with a contract or program or\nrequirement or term before you can delete the coordinating record. (APP-2276)\nHazard Abatement known limitations\nHomogeneous Areas not Highlighted. The application does not currently highlight all rooms identified as containing portions of homogeneous areas when\nthere are no assessments directly associated with those rooms. (APP-5240)\nWaste known limitations\nHazardous Waste Accumulation Report. The application stores and displays the hazardous waste accumulation volume limit application parameter value in\nunits of US Gallons. Users must take care to convert any other volume limit parameter into gallons if they adjust the application parameter controlling this. In any\ncase, the application does automatically and correctly convert the accumulated waste quantity to compare against this standard, no matter what units the waste\nhad been recorded in. (APP-5470)\nWaste Container Labels. The application generates formatted label documents for selected waste records. The web pop-up dialogue that shows the results of\nthe document creation has a bug limiting the display of outputted documents to 4 records. However, the application does still produce label documents for all the\nselected records as distinct files, named according to the waste record id number and saved to the .../WebCentral/schema/per-site/pdf-forms/[username] folder.\n(APP-5241)\nEnergy\u00a0known limitations\nProrating bills. Duplicate Bills. If you happen to enter duplicate bills for the same building and vendor with overlapping dates of service, and then attempt to\nauto-generate prorated bills, the application may encounter a duplicate primary key error when trying to generate one or more of the bill records. This is because\nthe resulting time periods will be the same, and the proration action will fail. (APP-5242, AD-924)\nConfigure Bill Processing. Excluded Bill Types. Archived Bills. The Configure Bill Processing view allows users to choose to exclude certain bill types from\nthe application's rules requiring bills to be archived in contiguous, ordered, monthly series. However, if an unusual situation occurs wherein a vendor account's\nutility bill type should change after some bills have already been archived, then the application will ignore a request to exclude the new bill type for new incoming\nbills for that vendor account. A work-around is to exclude both the old and new utility bill types from the monthly bill test. (APP-1855)\nProcess BAS Data View. The Web Central core does not yet support grid indexes on dates fields or on calculated fields. For example, if you create an index on\na date field having the value 2014-01-01, the value first shows as \u20182 \u2013 All.\u2019 If you click the \u20182\u2019 option, the value changes to \u201820\u2019; click the \u201820\u2019 and it's transformed to\n\u2018201\u2019; click the \u2018201\u2019 and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2019; click again, and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2026.\u2019 This issue appears in the right \u201cClean num\u201d panel in Energy\nManagement's Process BAS Data view. (WC-3108)\nView Prorated and Aggregated Bills. In rare cases, when the sum of aggregated bills exceeds a value 1000000 in the chosen display units, the application will\npresent an alert message stating that the value of the calculated field exceeds the field's maximum. In this view, the user may safely dismiss this message and\nproceed to view the bill record. (APP-5270)\nGreen Building known limitations\nFuel Density. Tree Panel. The Green Building / Background Data - Carbon footprint / Fuel Density task has a tree panel that manages two different levels of\ninformation. The tree panel does not display the second level. As a workaround, you can enter data so that both levels are shown, and then remove the data. (AD-\n1618)\nCapital Projects known limitations\nProjects known limitations\n\nProjects. Importing from Microsoft Project. From the Projects / Execute / Procure task / Import tab you can import an *.xml file from Microsoft Project.\nDepending on your version of Microsoft Project, you may need to choose to \u201cOpen as a new project.\" Otherwise, you may encounter errors with the\npredecessors values if you decide to append the data or merge the data. (3011985)\nProject Template. VPA. With VPA active, if you use the Projects / Set Up / Define Template Projects task to create a new project and enter a Project Type and\nTitle, you will find that the process fails and a template project is not created. As a work-around, add NULL to the Site VPA list; this allows a Project record to be\ngenerated. (AD-8105)\nConnectors known limitations\nReserved Words. Archibus does not support field names with reserved words. For example, adding the field \"alter\" to the table bl, causes the Archibus\napplication server to fail to start when attempting to restart it. Therefore, the INBOUND use case of importing data into an Archibus table that has a field named\nwith a reserved word is not supported. The OUTBOUND use case of exporting data to a remote system like BUILDER SMS that has a database field that uses a\nreserved word (ex. order) is supported. (APP-3975)(APP-4769)\nEDI Example. The example file provided for the EDI connector in the HQ project demonstrates Web Central\u2019s ability to process EDI data formats, but only\naddresses the bill table. Since the example lacks a bill_lines connector definition and a bill connector association, it is not possible to fully load a complete utility\nbill using the EDI connector example. In the future, we plan to make a new example that is more realistic available for download. (3047882)\nBackslash Character. In some environments entering \\\\ in connector field parameters or connector parameters may result in the \\\\ being saved as \\. As a\nworkaround, for a field enter \\\\\\\\ for \\\\ every time you save the field. For connector parameters, avoid use of \\\\; or, use \\\\\\\\ and fix configuration in post\nprocess. (3045250, 3047842)\nSaving. Saving a connector does not display the standard \u201cRecord Successfully Saved\u201d banner. (3045250)\nExtensions for BUILDERTM SMS known limitation\nAsset Attributes. Numeric Values. Separators. When entering numerical values for an asset attribute (ex. Quantity) do not enter a numeric separator such as\na comma. If a comma is entered in the asset attribute value as a numeric separator, the connector framework will not know how to process the comma and the\ndata transfer to BUILDER SMS will fail. (APP-5603)\nOutbound Connector. Condition Assessment Items. The master outbound connector SMS_ARCHIBUS_BUILDER_Inspect exports all condition assessment\nitems for a given section with date assessed in the past 90 days or within the number of days from current date set in the application parameter\nAbCapitalPlanningCA-BUILDER_InspectionDate_NewerThan and not only the most recent condition assessment record for the that section and for that\ntime interval. (APP- 4090)\nInbound Connectors. Number of Buildings. Sites do not record number of buildings transferred in from BUILDERTM SMS for the specific site. (APP-2401)\nInbound Connectors. Sections. Sections measured in pieces with quantity higher than 1 will not be split into multiple pieces of equipment when imported into\nArchibus. When transferring sections from BUILDERTM SMS measured in pieces and that have a quantity larger than one, Archibus does not create multiple\npieces of equipment. It creates only one piece of equipment with the corresponding value for the quantity attribute. (APP-2138)\nOutbound Connectors. Organizations and Sites. For new organizations and new sites transferred from Archibus to BUILDERTM SMS, the OUTBOUND\nconnectors do not set values to these BUILDERTM SMS fields:\nOrganization.UpdateCosts\nOrganization.UpdateCurves\nOrganization.ORG_ACF\nOrganization.ORG_SEISMICZONE\nOrganization.ORG_CI\nOrganization.ORG_FI\nOrganization.ORG_PI\nOrganization.ORG_FCI\nBUILDERTM SMS displays new organizations as new sites transferred from Archibus to BUILDERTM SMS, even without setting values to the above fields.\nBUILDERTM SMS users can enter the values for these fields using the BUILDERTM SMS interface. Running the OUTBOUND master connector a second time\nwill not affect the values entered by BUILDERTM SMS users for these fields. (APP-3215)\nArchibus V.2024.04\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Eptura, Inc.

Based on feedback from customers that a systems diagram was needed, we have added a diagram depicting the OnSite architecture\nsystem to the System Management Help. https://help.archibus.com/system/sysman.htm#onsite/architecture.htm (DOC-3491)\nChanges in Web Central\nBIM Viewer\nVPA Building Code. An error no longer occurs when using VPA\u00a0on Building Code. (AD-13448)\nAdditional Fields and Highlights. The Equipment Details form now includes fields for owner contact information as well as fields for leased equipment. There\nare also highlights for equipment assigned to leases: Assigned to Active Lease highlight and Leases Expiring Within 90 Days highlight. (AD-8499)\nUX. Equipment, Room, and Furniture Details. We have changed the layout of the BIM Viewer so that the Equipment Details, Room Details, and Furniture\nDetails show as a panel on the right side of the Viewer. Also the action of viewing details of equipment and rooms has been moved from on-selecting an element\nto right clicking on an element and then picking More Actions /View Details. (AD-14024, AD-14440)\nUX. Toolbar. The size of the upper toolbar has been adjusted based on the screen size and viewer size. Some icons will be shown on a second line if they do\nnot fit on one line. This solves a problem of not all toolbar buttons being visible with long building names. (AD-14357)\n\nUX. Documents. The Equipment Details pane now has a Documents button for accessing all documents related to an equipment item and its equipment\nstandard. (AD-9197)\nCatalog BIM Models. Count. The count of BIM rooms has been corrected and now shows only rooms that have been cataloged and correctly excludes rooms\ncreated manually.(AD-14183)\nUser Interface\nConsistent branding. (AD-14059, AD-13983)\nAdjust colors. (AD-3251, AD-3703)\nImprove layout resizing. (AD-12595)\nHide view edit buttons if user has no access. (AD-14425)\nAddress refresh issue when deleting assets.

This now correctly saves changes for equipment. (AD-14706)\nFrench Locale. We have resolved issues when publishing to 2D if the Smart Client Locale is set to French. (AD-14500)\n2D Publishing. We corrected a problem with 2D publishing in which Room layers were sometimes offset and rotated from the background layer. (AD-13679)\n2D Publishing. We corrected a problem with 2D publishing in which floor plans were taking into account it the \"origin\" point and therefore not publishing to the\nextents, but to a corner. (AD-13198)\n2D Publishing. We corrected a problem in which furniture was not published correctly and extra lines showed up in Space Console (AD-9474)\n3D Publishing to Forge. We corrected a problem when publishing to the common bucket. (AD-10374)\n3D Publishing to Forge. Now supports linked models. (AD-3905)\nSign Out.

(AD-12533)\n\nSmart Client\nSAML. Data Transfer and Export. We corrected a problem with the Data Transfer and Export commands failing to export data if you were running in an\nenvironment using SAML authentication. (AD-13886)\nChanges in Mobile Framework and Mobile Apps\nThere were no code changes for the Mobile framework and mobile apps for V.2023.03.\nChanges in Database\nSee Database Schema Revision History.\nChanges in Workplace\nLocalized V.2023.02 Strings. With a non-English locale, new V.2023.02 user interface elements no longer appear in English while the rest of the user interface\nappears in the user's selected locale. The localized strings for both V.2023.02 and V.2023.03 are available on AllBound's V2023.03 Downloads page. (AD-13591)\nSearch. When focus is on the filter panel, the focus now remains on the panel until the user tabs. Previously, when the search was completed, focus shifted\nautomatically to the floor plan. (AD-13716)\nMaintenance Requests. Comments. If a work request has a very large file attached, you can now save a comment that you enter. This was happening only for\nwork requests with large file attachments. (AD-11360)\nMeeting Room Reservations. Sort. On the Meeting Space Booking page, you can choose a sort order if the rooms are in List view. (AD-13436)\nMeeting Room Reservations. Invite Attendees. The Meeting Space Booking: Name and Attendees page has been redesigned from a card-based UI to a list\nso that you can more easily select and remove multiple attendees. (AD-12067)\nMeeting Room Reservations. Meeting Times. Previously, when you entered the time in your search for meeting rooms, and clicked Book from the list of\navailable rooms, the specified time was not highlighted in the time slider or entered in the start time/duration selectors. This has been corrected. (AD-13581)\nMeeting Room Reservations. Self-booking. QR\u00a0Codes. When self-booking a meeting room is not permitted (SelfServiceBookMeetingSpace = 0,\nKioskBookMeetingSpace = 0), previously, you would find that after scanning the QR code label, the Book button was displayed. It should have been hidden\nbased on the parameter settings. This has been corrected. (AD-9683)\nMeeting Rom Reservations. Dashboard. Previously, if there were two rooms with the same rm_type but different rm_cat values and you reserved one of these\nrooms, the meetings list on the Workplace dashboard would not show the reservation; however, if you checked the Reservations Calendar Console, you would\nsee that the room was indeed reserved. We have corrected this problem and the Workplace dashboard now shows the reservation. (AD-14659)\nWorkspace Bookings. Accessibility Mode. In Accessibility Mode, Workplace no longer conveys that a room is unavailable when, in fact, it is available for\nbooking. (AD-13569)\nWorkspace Bookings. Team Restriction. When the \u201cteam\u201d restriction is defined, and the space selected for booking is assigned to a specific team, the\noccupants selection list is now restricted to that team. (AD-11906)\nWorkspace Bookings. Team Membership If you are not a member of a team and the parameter AbSpaceHotelling.HotelBookingRestrictions =\nteam, you can book rooms for any employee, including yourself, regardless of the room\u2019s or employees' team membership. (AD-14476)\nWorkspace Bookings. Team Restriction. In the case that team restriction is enabled, and the Workplace user has at least one team membership, and the\nselected room has no team assignment, you can now book for all other employees who share at least one team assignment with you. (AD-12229)\nWorkspace Bookings. Fitler. We corrected a problem with the filter so that if you set a filter and then switch floors, Workplace now correctly applies the filter to\nthe new floor. (AD-14144)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nAndroid Tablet. Next Button. For several Service Request types, the Next button now correctly displays. (AD-12544)\nAndroid Tablet. Create Request. Next Button. If you run the Workplace mobile app on an Android tablet, you will find that if the selected request type presents\na questionnaire for you to answer as part of entering the request, Workplace now displays a Next button so that you can continue with the request. (AD-12848)\nService Requests. Supported File Types. Previously, the Workplace mobile app supported uploading png, jpg, and jpeg files. You can now upload additional\nfile types, such as email messages, forms, documents as well as photos. The exact set of file types supported for your site is specified in the afm-config.xml\nfile. (AD-11880)\nChanges in Archibus SaaS / Foundations\nArchibus Geospatial Extensions for Esri. This change was documented in the V.2023.02 revision history, but is repeated here for your convenience. The\nFoundations package now includes the Archibus Geospatial Extensions for Esri. In future releases, this license will be enabled as part of Foundations.\u00a0In the\nmeantime, contact Archibus Customer Support if you need this license activated. (DOC-3225)\nChanges in Assets\nAlso see above discussion, Changes in BIM\u00a0Viewer.\nManage Equipment and Standards. (ab-ess-def-eq.axvw). We have improved this view so that selecting one or more equipment standards immediately\ndisplays the equipment assigned to these standards in the right pane. Previously, a pop-up form showing equipment standard details displayed, and the user had\nto select the desired standards from this list. (AD-4574)\nChanges in Space\nSpace Console. Highlights. Highlights that combine Teams and Divisions or Teams and Departments now correctly work. (AD-14040)\nSpace Console. Highlight Colors. We have corrected a problem with the shade of a particular color being displayed differently in the Space Console Legend,\nFloor Plan highlight, and the PDF report highlights. (AD-3703)\nSpace Console. Export to DOCX or Excel. The Export feature now correctly exports all records listed in the tabs (Room Categories, Employees, Rooms, and\nso on) to XLS or DOCX. The export follows the record limit settings defined afm-config.xml. (AD-13752, AD-13368, AD-14562)\nSpace Console. Search by Team. Previously, if you selected Show Teams in View Settings and used the Advanced Search form to search for a team, floor\nplans that have assigned teams were not showing. This has been corrected. (AD-12821)\nMove Console. Highlighting. We corrected a problem with the floor plan not being highlighted correctly when editing an existing move request. (AD-14204)\nChanges in Maintenance\nMaintenance Console. Account Information. We have corrected a problem with editing fields under the Account Information panel of the Additional Details tab.\n(AD-14280)\nChanges in Workplace Services\nArchibus Extension for Exchange Integration. Reservation with No Subject. Previously, if you created a reservation with no subject, the message stayed in\nthe user's calendar and the reservation could not be found in Archibus. This has been corrected. (AD-13528)\nArchibus Extension for Exchange Integration. Division Code. Previously, a reservation made through Archibus and synced to Exchange did correctly\npopulate the Requestor's Division, but a reservation created in Exchange and synced to Archibus did not populate the Division of the Requestor. This has been\ncorrected. (AD-14661)\nReservations Calendar Console. Double-byte Characters and Comments Field. Previously, the Calendar Console presented an error message when you\nattempted to confirm a reservation whose comment included double-byte characters and was larger than 4000 characters. This has been corrected, and the\nworkaround of entering smaller comments when a comment includes double-byte characters is no longer necessary. (AD-436)\n\nOutlook Plugin. Implementation. We have corrected a problem with the room-reservation.install.properties not transferring to room-\nreservation.install.properties. (AD-13940)\nManage Service Level Agreements. User Interface. For clarity, we have renamed the action \u201cAdd Approval\u201d to \u201cAdd Edit and Approve\u201d and we have renamed\nthe action \u201cAdd Confirmation\u201d to \u201cAdd Approve.\u201d (AD-14215)\nChanges in Real Property\nLease Portfolio Console. Documents. With no document attached, the \u201cView\u201d button is now disabled. With a document attached, the \u201cView\u201d button is active\nand the attached document can be downloaded and viewed. (AD-13873)\nLease Portfolio Console. Bulk Lease Renewal. If you select an already existing lease for the new Lease Code, you no longer receive a workflow rule error;\ninstead, you receive a message to enter a new Lease Code. (AD-14038)\nRent Roll Report. We have corrected a problem with exporting records from this view. (AD-14670)\nChanges in Sustainability & Risk\nGreen Building. Fuel Density. Tree Panel. The Green Building / Background Data - Carbon footprint / Fuel Density task has a tree panel that manages two\ndifferent levels of information. The tree panel now correctly displays the second level. (AD-1618)\nArchibus\u00a0Help known limitations\nNon-English help from the Navigator. If you use the right-click Help command on a Navigator process, you will receive an error message that the topic cannot\nbe found. This is because the localized version of Archibus Help does not contain topics at this level of detail. In a future release, the right-click Help command\nwill load the appropriate topic from the English version of Archibus Help. (AD-2786)\nArchibus SaaS known limitations\nHome Page Publishing. SaaS Partner Administrator. If you sign in as a SaaS Partner Administrator (such as sample user AFM-BP), run the System / SaaS\nPartner Administrator / Manage Home Pages and Processes task, modify a home page, and publish your changes; you receive an error message. As a\nworkaround: use System / Add-In Manager / Publish Home Pages by Role to publish home pages after modifying them. (APP-6426)\nNavigator for AFM-MOD Sample User. If you sign in to the HQ sample project as AFM-MOD, you will notice that the Navigator groups modules into domains\n(including the Archibus SaaS domain) so that the Navigator presents four levels. Having some modules grouped under the Archibus SaaS domain may be\nconfusing if you are demonstrating or learning the product. This change is a result of the Healthcare module being added to the Navigator and the Navigator now\nexceeding 13 modules. This can be resolved by removing a module that you do not need. (AD-12985)\nOnSite mobile app known limitations\nManage Configurations for OnSite task. The Save message does not dismiss and prevents you from moving to other tabs; this message displays even if you\nhave not made any changes. As a workaround, access the OnSite parameters using the System / Archibus Administrator - Application Configuration / Configure\nApplication Parameters task and restrict to the AbOnSiteMobile application. (AD-15513)\nAndroid. Accessing Documents. If you attempt to open a DOCX file linked to a work request on an Android phone, you receive an error message. This is a\nresult of the phone not having an app to open DOCX files. You can install an app for this purpose. (ON-1495)\nNotifications. Chinese. Push notifications are not yet supported for Chinese. (ON-1058)\nNotifications. Oracle. With an Oracle deployment, you cannot receive notification from OnSite; if you check the Web Central Notifications Log view, you will not\nsee any messages sent from OnSite. (ON-1237)\nNew Requests. Cannot See. After you create a new request, you may not see it in the Request List because it is added to the end of the request list. You can\nuse the pull-to-refresh feature to re-sort the requests according to the \u201corder by\u201d option.(ON-487)\nWork Request List. Updating. When you create a new request, it is added to the bottom of the list because the sort order of work requests is not updating to\nreflect a new request. Pulling to refresh solves this issue.(ON-723)\nWorkplace known limitations\nRebuild Workplace. Yarn. In order to rebuild Workplace after customizing, you must run the Yarn command, which is generating an error. For information on\nresolving this, see https://help.archibus.com/system/sysman.htm#workplace/build_process.htm. (AD-15467)\nRooms. Selecting from Floor Plan. When you click on a room in the floor plan to select it, you might experience that Workplace does not fully highlight the\nroom border. This can occur for both meeting room and workspace selection. (AD-14874)\nSign in. SSO. If you have set up Web Central for request header SSO and enabled UseSingleSessionForConcurrentUsers in security.properties,\nif you attempt to access [WEB CENTRAL URL]/archibus/workplace/ directly, you are not able to log in. You must first access Web Central and then load\nWorkplace from there. Similarly, if you load Workplace, copy the URL, close the browser without signing out, open a new browser and paste the URL, you will not\nbe able to log in. (AD-11342, AD-12854)\nTablet. iPad Pro. People & Places. UI. The email address in the right panel is not properly displayed. (AD-9466)\nTablet. iPad pro/Safari. SSO If you start Workplace in a Safari browser and without signing out, you close the web browser window fully and then reopen the\nweb browser window and attempt to navigate to Workplace again, you will not be able to start Workplace. To work around the issue, clear the browser cache and\nreopen the browser. Or, open the browser, close the Workplace tab which is stuck, open a new tab and enter a Web Central or Workplace URL. This was tested\non iOS 16.2. (AD-12878)\nTablet. iPad Pro/Safari. The header is truncated, and on some pages cuts off buttons. This occurs in both landscape and portrait modes. (AD-13718)\nMeeting Room Reservations\nAccessibility Mode. In accessibility mode, if you edit a single meeting room booking, you cannot select the desired start time/duration values and you receive a\nmessage that your change is not saved. (AD-14711)\nPre and Post Block Times. If you search for a meeting room with a given time frame, select an available room, and then change the meeting time so that it\noverlaps with an existing meeting's pre and post block times, you can still reserve the room despite the overlapped pre or post block times. Likewise, if you are\nbooking recurring meetings, you can book meeting times that overlap with pre and post block times of existing meetings. (AD-14709, AD-14707)\nMultiple Room Configurations. In Workplace, we assume that only one configuration and one room arrangement has been defined for a room. If you create\nmultiple room configurations with the Reservations application, the configurations will appear in Workplace, but there is no distinguishing information about the\nconfigurations and the user will not know which space they are reserving. There will also appear to be a discrepancy between the available room count and the\nnumber of rooms shown on the floor plan. (AD-835, APP-5194, APP-5845)\nRecurrence Pattern. Workspace reservations do not show recurrence patterns in the details view. You can only delete a single occurrence at a time. AD-835)\nTime Slots. Meeting space requests do not honor the value of the parameter in AbWorkplaceReservations-MinutesTimeUnit. You can only select time\nintervals in 30-minute blocks. (AD-7010)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nNavigation When Re-opening Workplace. Upon closing and re-opening the Workplace mobile app, you will be taken to the sign-in page instead of the home\npage. (AD-14752)\nScrolling and Extra Spaces. There are improper empty spaces above the header and below the footer. There are two redundant scroll bars that appear when it\nis impossible to scroll up or scroll down. (AD-13929)\nQR Codes. The Home button is not available after scanning a QR code; from QR Code page, it is difficult to navigate to the login screen. (AD-9659, AD-9681)\nSigning In. Android. Version of Mobile Client. You cannot log in if you are not using Mobile Client 4.0. As a workaround, upgrade to Mobile Client 4.0. (AD-6801)\nWorkspace Bookings. Room List. Sort By. The Room Code/Room Name field title is partially hidden behind the select value drop-down arrow. Functionality is\nnot impeded, as a selection can still be made. (AD-15045)\n\nWorkspace Bookings. Multiple Employees. If you book workspaces for more than 3 or 4 employees, the booking card of last employee is slightly hidden so\nthat you cannot see the complete name. Closing the \"Open in App\" banner will make the booking card fully visible. (AD-14904)\nWorkspace Bookings. Select Occupants. If you try to book six or more staff for working space, the UI cannot correctly display you selected employees. (AD-\n8599)\nMeeting Space Recurring Reservations. Setting Times. When you try to set the time for the recurring reservation, the marker and the keyboard display very\nbriefly and then immediately disappear again, leaving you unable to delete or type any values. Workaround: Use the Calendar icon to select the desired date.\nNote: This behavior does not occur when you attempt to edit the Dates on the Search Meeting Spaces filter or when entering a Move Request. There, it behaves\nas expected and editing is possible. (AD-15015)\nService Request. Large Attachments. Alert Message. If you attempt to attach a file larger than 2MB, Workplace should present a message stating that the file\nis too large. However, Workplace is not displaying this message. (AD-15110, AD-15259)\nService Request. Photos. Create a new service request and add a photo; when you open the request via My Requests or Web Central, you will see that the\nphoto is not attached to the service request. (AD-13011)\nService Request. Uploading Both Images and Documents. Due to device and application permissions, it is not possible to upload both camera images and\nother file types from the device in the same service request. (AD-13309, AD-13928)\nAndroid Tablet. Unsupported File Types. When running the Workplace mobile app on an Android tablet, you will find that if you select an supported file type to\nadd to a service request, Workplace does not display a message instructing you that the file type is not supported. No file is added and the screen remains the\nsame as before any selection was made. Note: With permissions not allowed (selection drawer does not display), the message does display on selecting an\nunsupported file type. (AD-15056)\nAndroid Tablet. QR Scan. When applied in a mobile browser, the URL generated by a room correctly takes the user to the Room booking view. However, in the\nWorkplace Mobile app running on an Android tablet, the URL generated by the room QR scan incorrectly takes you to Workplace Dashboard view. (AD-13986)\nWeb Central known limitations\nExport to XLS. Views with Export to XLS commands that use a Verbatim datasource and have printRestriction set to True, can give an error and export a\nlimited set of data. Setting printRestriction to False in the view works around the issue. (AD-14799)\nBIM\u00a0Viewer.\nLocalized. In localized versions of Archibus, you will find that the tooltips on the Autodesk Forge toolbar are not localized. (AD-12210)\nBlank Worksheets. For some Revit 2022 models, the new feature \u201cSheets & Views\u201d may display the worksheets as blank. This is an issue with the\nAutodesk Platform Services API that we could not fix on our side and we are waiting for Autodesk to fix. (AD-10801)\nSelect Values. Floors. For 2.0 views that have a filter that includes the Floor Code field, the view may not show all available floors. The root cause is that the\ncore UI grid control determines the number of pages based on the number of index records. For the Floor selector, the index uses the Building Code, i.e. there\nare 111 buildings with floors. Thus, the grid shows only two pages of floor records (one page = 100 records). (AD-3706)\nQuestionnaires. Non-English. Questionnaires, such as those in Condition Assessment and Sustainability Assessment, do not allow assessors to edit out-of-\nthe-box, sample questions that have been localized from English (US) to other languages. The workaround is for Archibus Administrators to use Archibus Smart\nClient to edit the text of these sample questions. This issue affects only sample data questionnaires that have been localized from English. (AD-1547)\nExtended Questionnaires. Document/Photo. The Web Central questionnaire form (for both Compliance and Maintenance) does not currently support\nrespondent-initiated submission of more than one document/photo attachment per question, whether or not the questionnaire designer specifies a value greater\nthan 1 for Maximum Number Responses. The mobile app does support this feature. You cannot delete the uploaded document after Save the question-answer;\nthere is no action when clicking the X button. A questionnaire designer should take this into account when designing forms. (APP-2426, AD-4431)\nIf the intended respondents will be using Web Central to submit documents and flexibility in number of document responses is desired, then the designer\ncan work around the limitation by defining a parent question containing a follow-up question of type document and allow multiple instances of the parent\nquestion.\nFor example, parent question could be multiple choice \"attach a document?\" Yes/No. If Yes, then the application shows the document question as a\nfollow-up. Set up the \"Attach a document\" question to allow multiple answers, such that the respondent can add another, answer \"Yes\" and so on.\nHome Page Editor. Maps. When creating home pages, you add only one map bucket to each home page. (WC-2790)\nHome Pages. Localized. For some international users, home pages may display English titles for columns in the Metric Trends panel. If this issue occurs, the\nuser can switch to a different home page and go back, or sign out and sign in again. (WC-2373)\nGrid. Export To XLS/DOC. Smart Search Console. When you use the Smart Search Console (mini-console) to filter and then try to export the grid, you receive\na message that you are unable to export to Excel or Doc. (AD-14070)\nGrid. Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) Fields. If working with a view in which you define highlight patterns (such as Space / Space Inventory / Background\nData / Define Division and Department Highlight Patterns, ab-sp-create-dp-hatch.axvw), and you set a gradient highlight, create a swatch bitmap, and refresh the\nview, the Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) field will not correctly show the swatch bitmap for the gradient highlight. Instead, the fields show the same color for all\ngradient highlight definitions. (WC-2748)\nGrid 3.0. Grid Control 3.0, which is used in views such as PM Planner (ab-pm-planner.axvw) and Service Console (ab-request-console.axvw), presents an error\nif you try to sort by a field that is not from the main table. (AD-8474)\nView Titles. Menu Options Hidden. When a view title is too long, the top menu actions (User Menu, User Help, Add to Favorites) and client logo are not visible.\n(AD-4820)\nSchema Change Wizard. Oracle. When using Schema Change Wizard on an Oracle database, you may face the error ORA-01031: insufficient privileges when\nchoosing to re-create any of the Archibus security tables: afm_users; afm_groups. Resolution: Choose \"Alter existing table structures (preserves additional\nfields)\" option when trying to update afm_users/afm_groups tables. (3045736)\nSmart Client known limitations\nNavigator. With a non-SaaS license, logging in to the Smart Client as AFM incorrectly produces a Navigator that includes an Archibus SaaS process. (AD-3794)\nNavigator. Non-English Locale. If you launch Web Central from the Smart Client and are using a non-English locale, the Web Central Navigator will not display\nyour applications and tasks. (AD-3866)\nSAML. Connecting to SAML requires user to make server selection on subsequent sign-ins. (AD-1996)\nCertificate Authentication. Web Central Tasks. Cannot data transfer or launch Web Central if Certificate Authentication is in effect. (SMAR-626)\nEditing Standards Tables. If you edit Furniture Standards or Equipment Standards with the default database, the titles for the Length and Width fields will show\nincorrectly as \"ft\" or \"M\". If you log in with a different locale (e.g. view an Imperial project as a Metric user) the program will convert the values. The condition also\noccurs in Furniture or Equipment Standards views loaded in Web Central. To avoid this condition in both environments, load the Archibus Fields table (afm_flds),\nfind the Length and Width fields, and change their Numeric Format from \"Length\" to \"Default\". (3037311)\nDeleting a Record with a date/time Field as Part of its Primary Key. You are unable to delete records from tables that have a date/time field as part of the\nprimary key, such as the ehs_medical_mon_results table. There are no such errors when deleting records from the same table in Web Central views. (WC-2169)\nDeleting. hwr and hwo Tables. It is not possible to delete records from Smart Client grid views that present these tables. As a work-around, delete the records\nfrom Web Central. (SMAR-596)\nDeleting. Bulk Editing. Currently there is no way of bulk deleting data from Smart Client. If you select all records and then hit Delete, only those records\ncurrently displayed on screen are deleted; all of the other records that are selected but not on screen remain. As a work-around, in View Definition Wizard, create\na single panel interactive report for the table in question, choose only the primary key field(s) unless you need to add a restriction. In the preview pane, enable\nadvanced editing, and add multipleSelectionEnabled=\u201dtrue\u201d in the panel, then insert a panel action with a command type deleteSeletedRows.\nSave Changes and preview the view and you can check all and delete right from the preview, without needing to save/publish it. (SMAR-17)\nRibbon. The Smart Client ribbon is very small on high resolution monitors. (SMAR-503)\nGrid. Refresh when Filtering. After you set and clear a filter, the grid does not correctly update record counts and refresh. As a workaround, run the Clear\naction on the menu ribbon. (SMAR-609)\nReplace Column. When there are more than two tables in the standard role attached to the Smart Client grid view, the command presents errors. (SMAR-528)\n\nModified Views Cannot be Saved as the Default View. Log in as a user that has the Security group SYS-VIEW-ALTER (such as AFMX), open a view, change\nthe view, save, and make it the default view. Reload, and the default view will not reflect your changes. (SMAR-329)\nExplorer pane. Recent Views List. When you create new views and save them in the Explorer's list of recent views, you can save up to 8 views. When you\nsave the ninth view, the system removes the newest view from the list. It should remove the oldest view from the list. (SMAR-907)\nData Transfer. Dates deleted from the output file are not cleared in the database after transferring in the file with the changes made. (SMAR-671)\nSmart Client Extension for AutoCAD\u00a0known limitations\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nQuery Table. The Query Table command does not include fields that contribute to the primary key; for example, it does not show the Building Code and Floor\nCode values for rooms. (SMAR- 798)\nHighlighting commands\nUnclosed polylines. If some areas don't highlight with solid highlights, they might be open not closed polylines. If so, close them. The AutoCAD solids\ndon't fill unclosed-closed polylines. AutoCAD hatch patterns do, however. Notice that if you have multiple areas of one type (e.g. Office standard), having\none unclosed polyline may cause others to also not have a solid fill (since Archibus hatches many of them in one go for efficiency's sake). (3030818)\nHatch patterns. The Archibus-defined patterns (from the .pat file) are not being loaded into AutoCAD at the time of highlighting. Only the out-of-the-box\nAutoCAD patterns work as expected because the highlighting logic defaults to a SOLID hatch pattern if it can't find the pattern definition. (SMAR-902)\nLarge floor plans. When dealing with very large floor plans (3,500 rooms on a single floor), commands like Catalog Layer and Highlight by Department do not\ngive progress feedback, but function correctly.\nAsset Text Height. The Smart Client Extension ignores the atxt_ht_in and atxt_ht_cm in favor of the atxt_ht value, which is in inches. For metric drawings the\nSCE converts this to cm. (SMAR-189)\nEdit Data. Suite areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0.\nIf you press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nTrial layers. Asset text. Asset text is left-justified instead of center-justified. (SMAR-492)\nExplorer window. Anchoring. When you open a drawing from within the Smart Client drawings list, the Explorer window should be positioned according to the\nsettings made in the previous session; instead, it opens in the floating position and you must reset it. (SMAR-702)\nDrawing Publishing\u00a0\nAutoCAD Leader objects. EMF does not support arrows or text with the leaders. SVG supports only solid arrows. (3044919)\nSecondary circulation areas as regions. As documented in\nhttps://www.archibus.net/ai/abizfiles/v23_help/archibus_help/user_en/archibus.htm#../Subsystems/webc/Content/web_user/space/concepts/open_plan.htm,\nyou can draw accurate polylines for secondary circulation using AutoCAD REGIONS. Publishing these drawings may result in rooms being set incorrectly\nin front of or behind other rooms. In order for rooms within a secondary circulation region to be shown and highlighted in front of the secondary circulation\nspace in a published drawing, they must be numbered higher than the secondary circulation space. (3051186)\nXREF The XREF Layer does not publish when the TURNOFFALL* value is specified in the additional layers field. As a workaround, turn off layers\nindividually and do not use the TURNOFFALL* feature to control XREF Layers.(SMAR-1001)\nAFM_NET_LISP \"Publish\" command. Ignores the viewWindow attribute when the publishType is EMF and the generated file is published to extents.\n(SMAR-737).\nSVG. Background Color. If you set the Set the ColorMapping field to BLACK for AbPubBackground in the sample HQ database and publish, the black\nbackground does not appear to take effect. This is because there are multiple active rules in the database, and later results overwrite the earlier ones. To\nresolve this either (a) set the Active flag to No for all of the SVG files except for one; or, (b) specify a unique Rule Suffix (e.g. -bl, -reg, -eq) for each rule,\nexcept for the one that has a Color Mapping value so that different rules will produce different output files. (SMAR-417)\nSVG. Hatches. Complex hatches, meaning that there are multiple polylines that are used as the boundaries for the hatch, do not publish to SVG; whereas\nhatches that do successfully publish are contained in a single polyline. You can separate the hatches using HATCHEDIT, and the publishing will work as\nexpected. (SMAR-513)\nRefreshing. Firefox. If your workstation uses Firefox and you load a drawing's enterprise graphics in Web Central or in the Smart Client, then republish\nthat drawing's enterprise graphics, the change may not appear when you reload the view with the enterprise graphics. For performance reasons, some\nversions of Firefox do not immediately refresh the enterprise graphics files from their local cache even when the file has a later time stamp, as checking\nthe time stamp involves an extra query to the server for each file. To view your changes, clear your cache or restart your browser. If you wish to see\nchanges immediately without clearing your cache, you can change your browser cache settings to control the problem.\n1. In Firefox's menu, select Tools >\u00a0Options.\n2. Select the Advanced tab, and then the Network tab.\n3. In the Offline Storage section, enter 0 for the MB of space used for the cache.(3024655)\nSmart Client Extension for Revit known limitations\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nRooms. Mapping to Revit. Room Code is not automatically filled in when Archibus Rooms are mapped to Revit Spaces. If you run Edit Data on the room, the\nrm_id is correctly saved in the database after manually selecting it in the Edit Data form. (AD-14073)\nRooms. Linked Models. The rm_id is not recognized when cataloging the Equipment Items from an MEP model linking back to an ARCHITECTURAL model. As\na workaround, catalog the equipment from the Architectural model using the BIM Explorer. (AD-14277)\nUncatalog. With Revit 2022 running on Windows 11, you cannot select Asset Type on the Uncatalog form. (AD-10027)\nNames of Models and Levels. Currently, the Smart Client Extension for Revit does not support model names or level names containing the '-' character. (AD-\n9418)\nFile Names with Special Characters. When you publish a Revit file whose file name contains spaces and characters such as #+\u00b0$(), you may receive an error\nmessage when viewing the SVG file in Web Central. (WC-3132)\nOpening a Model. Error Message. Due to the way that Updater classes are implemented, Revit presents a message that you are missing a third-party updater.\nYou can ignore this message. (SMAR-974).\nNumber.\nIf you Number a room and then use the Smart Client to show the Room field \"Perimeter ft\u201d, the perimeter shows as 0. If you Data Edit or Data Edit\nMultiple, the number is corrected. (SMAR-285)\nIf the database does not contain enough information for the Number command to execute, it fails to number instead of providing feedback to the user\nabout what database information is needed to successfully run the command. (SMAR-526)\nRooms. Deleting. Revit does not notify Archibus when Revit deletes rooms. Currently, Archibus cannot uncatalog rooms on that event. Use the Synchronization\n/ Uncatalog Records without Assets command to clear the Drawing Name and Id fields on these rooms in one step.\nWeb Query. If the last primary key value for an asset is a single digit (e.g. if you query for room \"1\"), then the pop up dialog results are not restricted to that one\nrecord. This doesn't occur for two- and three-digit IDs (e.g. room \"10\" or \"100\"). (3035367, 3035366, 3034950, 3034414)\nPublish Enterprise Graphics. Colors. Since Revit floor plans do not have color, colors for Enterprise Graphics generated from Revit can cause confusion,\nespecially since the user does not have control over this. In a future release, Archibus will address this issue. (SMAR-988)\nEdit Data\u00a0\nRooms. Some objects in linked models are not correctly picking up room codes of the rooms they are inside of. (SMAR-785)\nGroup Areas. For new groups, the Group Code will show as \"1\" until the record is actually saved. Thereafter, the proper autonumbered ID will show.\n(3034828)\n\nSuite Areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0. If\nyou press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nLong Parameter Values. If you have a parameter value (e.g. Name) mapped to an Archibus field (e.g. Option 1), and that parameter has an existing\nvalue longer than the field width in Archibus, then you will not be able to create a record using Edit Data. You can shorten the parameter value using the\nRevit Parameters dialog. Alternately, if you use the Archibus Catalog command, the command will find all of these conditions and allow you to rectify them\nindividually or in groups. (3034793)\nMap Database Fields. This form is empty if there are no assets in the model of the specified asset type. (3034357)\nCopy / Paste. If you copy and paste furniture and equipment, you also copy and paste their Revit properties. Use the Archibus synchronization commands to\nfind and resolve any duplicates. (3030989)\nOutlook Plugin known limitations\nRegistry Entry to Keep Enabled. To ensure the Plugin cannot be disabled by users and will not be disabled automatically by Outlook, you must replace the\nfollowing DWORD registry value (which is added by the standard installer)\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=dword:1\nwith a string value.\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=\"1\"\nThis replacement can be implemented by customizing the Outlook Plugin MSI installer with a customization tool such as Master Packager. (AD-10391)\nSystem Administration known limitations\nSecurity. False positive vulnerability. If you do a Veracode scan on Web Central, you will receive a vulnerability warning concerning\nHttpInvokerServiceExporter, which is used by Spring. Note that Web Central does not use HttpInvokerServiceExporter, so you can ignore this warning. (AD-12773)\nSecurity. LDAP. The result of using a distinguished name with a comma results in this error in archibus.log: \"LDAP: error code 49 - Invalid Credentials\". The\nsolution is to change the bind user's \"CN=\" value to a name that does not contain a comma. (3037258)\nSecurity. SSO. In SSO mode, when the user name is incorrect, the user is redirected to the timeout page instead of the SSO error page. (WC-2027)\nIofT. Oracle. The Technologies / Innovative Solutions /Integrations - IoT / IoT Space Utilization view is not Oracle-compatible. (AD-8296)\nSolution Templates. Calendar Control. The Reservations Calendar example records multiple days for one-day events. (WC-3237)\nConnectListener. When ConnectListener runs, it does not move the previous afm_conn_log entries to afm_conn_logh. (AD-7003)\nSchema Change Wizard. The archibus.log fails to show correctly field and table name in the global dataset. This is only a logging issue. There is no functional\nerror. (3033565)\nGrid. API. Grid panels can display custom values calculated in Java Script code. An example can be seen in the following view. This example displays the\ncustom Location field that is composed from Building, Floor, Room, and Location database fields. The example also includes a menu that allows the user to\nproduce reports with the grid data. Due to Web Central technical implementation limitation, custom values formatted in Java Script code cannot be displayed in\nthese reports. (3041685)\nPath: Technologies / User Interface Add-Ins / Assemblies with Multiple Panels / Find-Manage with Categories\nFile: ab-products\\solutions\\assemblies\\work-wizard\\ab-ex-work-wizard.js\nFunction: updateLocations()\nGrid. API. When designing views with a grid panel, you cannot set specific grid column width in pixels. The grid automatically sets column widths according to\nthe available space and the data displayed in each column. (3045398)\nGrid. API. The Clear Filter icon is not visible if the last grid column is hidden. To avoid the issue, add an empty last column. The condition does not affect any of\nthe Archibus applications. (3040363)\nDatabase known limitations\nDatabase Update Wizard. runDuw.sql script. The Database Update Wizard generates an SQL script called runDuw.sql. When writing this file, it does not\nreplace macros with SQL. (AD-10595)\nMobile Framework known limitations\nFail to log in again when reloading mobile client. iOS. If you log in, close mobile client, and then attempt to log in again, you will find that you cannot log in.\nThe failure stems from being already logged into the OIDC connector and trying to reestablish a session. IOS has not been fully upgraded for service workers\ndue to extra restrictions service workers have in IOS Safari. Therefore IOS still requires the connection checks. A workaround is to wait until the OIDC session is\ninvalid/logged out, as well as not selecting \"remember me\" (for example in Okta) while on IOS. Not closing the app while there is a valid session will avoid this\nissue entirely. This is not an issue for Android. (AD-6517)\nSurveys. Measurement questions. Android. With the survey (questionnaire) features in both Maintenance and Compliance Surveys mobile apps, users can\nenter non-numeric values for Measurement questions. These values do not correctly upload when the mobile apps are synced. A future version will add\nvalidation so that users can input only numbers as the answer of Measurement type questions. (AD-4600)\nMobile App known limitations\nCompliance Surveys. Questionnaires. If a questionnaire requires a service request and the service request is created and then deleted, the questionnaire will\nstill indicate the service request step is complete. (AD-9047)\nMaintenance. Resources. If you add resources, such as parts, tools, and costs, you will not see the new resource records in both Resource Details form. Thus,\nyou might think the resource records were not added. After syncing, you will see that the resource record were successfully added. (AD-5908)\nMaintenance.uniqueidentifier Error. Due to Archibus resetting an application parameter for use with OnSite, users of the Maintenance mobile app will\nencounter the \"uniqueidentifier property to be defined\" error after completing a checklist or refreshing the screen. To resolve this, run System / Archibus\nAdministrator - Application Configuration / Configure Application Parameters and reset the AbCommonResources.MobileSyncDataChangesOnlyTables\napplication parameter to: bl;eq;rm;rmpct;dv;dp;fl;em;pt_store_loc_pt. (AD-11666, AD-11679)\nMaintenance. Checklists. Android 11. If you try to create a request from a work request's checklist, you receive a blank screen. This occurs only on Android 11.\n(AD-5863)\nMaintenance. Stopping Work. Supervisors cannot stop a work request that has a pending checklist. (AD-4883)\nMaintenance. Reopening a Checklist when Verifying It. If a supervisor reopens a checklist during the verify process, the work request correctly moves back to\nthe Issued status. If this work request's checklist is still pending and the supervisor or craftsperson now selects multiple work requests to complete (including this\none), you will find that you can complete this work request despite the fact that it has an open checklist. The issue does not occur when working from the My\nWork form because the form does not support multi-select action. (AD-4882)\nMaintenance. Confirmation. SLAs can contain Confirmation steps on the \"Issued\" and \"Completed\" statuses. Users who are assigned to these steps can\nperform the confirmation (Approve/Reject/Cancel) in the Maintenance Console, but this feature is not supported in the mobile Maintenance app. Confirmation\nsteps work only on the \"Requested\" and \"Assigned to Work Order\" statuses on mobile. (AD-7267)\nMaintenance. Sync Issues.\nWhen a user performs a Sync action on the mobile Maintenance app, any craftspersons hours data (such as Actual Hours or Overtime Hours) can be\noverwritten if those hours were entered in Web Central. (3045897)\nWhen a requestor reports multiple maintenance requests of the same type from different locations and then syncs to upload all the requests at once, the\nmobile app does not consistently upload all the requests. To avoid this problem, sync after entering each request. (3048805).\n\nPart quantities are synced on the mobile Maintenance app only when you sync the background data. This affects mobile users who perform any of the\nfollowing actions on the mobile maintenance application:\no Estimate parts on a work request\no Add purchased parts to inventory\no Complete a work request that includes parts\nAfter you perform any of these actions and sync, the system will update the part quantities correctly in the database and they will appear correctly in Web\nCentral; however, the mobile application will not show these new quantities. Also, any changes made by other mobile users or Web Central users to the\npart quantities will not be synced. The workaround is to go the Sync settings on the mobile application and click the button that says \u201cReset Background\nData Sync Flag\u201d. When you return to the Maintenance application, the background data will automatically sync, and the part quantities will be updated on\nthe device. (3053237)\nMaintenance. Seeing Rejected Requests. Approvers can reject requests back to the requestor or step completer. However, mobile users cannot see or\nresubmit those rejected requests from the mobile application. This must be done from the Building Operations Console.(3048370)\nMaintenance. Photos. You can request maintenance from the Workplace Services Portal app and the Maintenance app, and you can update maintenance\nrequests from the Maintenance app. However, the two apps store maintenance photos in different tables (wr and activity_log), which can cause problems when\nediting or deleting a photo. When you request maintenance using the Workplace Services Portal app and add a photo, and then access the corresponding work\nrequest using the Maintenance app, the photo will be shown. However, if later the photo is deleted by the Maintenance team from the work request (wr) record,\nthe photo will not be deleted from the activity_log record, and vice versa. There are several alternative scenarios for adding, changing, or deleting photos which\nmay cause this kind of issue. This issue will be fixed in a future release. (3047423)\nWorkplace Portal. Chinese. If you enter a space after a Building Code value, you will encounter an error with Rooms / Locate Employee. (AD-5913)\nWorkplace Services known limitations\nHoteling known limitations\nBookings for a Date Range report. We have found that there is problem selecting the floor plan for the SRL\u00a0building. This occurs only for this building in the HQ\nsample project. (AD-14743)\nService Desk known limitations\nManage Request Types. Non-English Locale. When using the Service Desk / Service Desk Manager / Manage Request Types view (ab-create-activitytype-\ntabs.axvw) to edit request types that have been translated into other locales, the request type does not appear correctly in Service Desk Manager edit form. (AD-\n2813)\nReservations known limitations\nGCal. Cancellation Syncing. Events created in GCal and canceled in Archibus are not synced back to GCal. The reverse -- a reservation created in Archibus\nand deleted in GCal -- is also not synced.A reservation canceled in one environment should also be deleted in the other. (AD-14875, AD-13997)\nReservations Calendar Console. Attendees in Room. Does not correctly set the \u201cAttendees in Room\u201d field value when creating meetings; there is no way for\na user to manually edit this value. (AD-4856)\nReservations Calendar Console. Recurring Reservations for Monthly Meetings. The timeline does not always correctly display recurring patterns for\nmonthly meetings. For example, if you created a reservation for the first Monday of the month, the Reservations Calendar Console might show all Mondays in\nthe month. Although the timeline might not display these reservations correctly, the Console does correctly save these meeting dates and the summary text\nreflects the proper date. (APP-6651)(AD-1028)\nReservations Calendar Console. Room Configurations. For situations in which multiple reservations exist at the same time in the same room, but for different\nroom configurations, the calendar displays only one reservation. (APP-6561)\nReservations Calendar Console. Continuous Meetings. The system does not prompt you resolve continuous meetings that have conflicts; when it encounters\nthis situation, the system generates a workflow rule error. (APP-6535)\nReservations Calendar Console. Conference Calls.\nIf you create a conference call and you select several buildings in order to select rooms in several buildings; and if many of the rooms in one building are\nreservable, all of the rooms for this building are shown, and reservable rooms from other buildings are not displayed. This can make hard to select rooms\nfrom different buildings. The TimelineMaxRoomsPerBuilding application parameter does not control this.(APP-6214)\nYou cannot edit the date and time of a conference call reservation. (APP-6613)\nReservations Calendar Console. Changing Room Selection. Time not Recorded. If you select a room, select a time, add some resources, and select\nanother room; you will find that the designated time does not persist to the second room. (APP-6800)\nReservations Calendar Console. Application Parameters. The TimelineStartTime and TimelineEndTime parameters work only with one-hour\nincrements. If you enter times such as 9:30 and 17:30 in the parameters, the Calendar Console does not consider them. (APP-6698)\nCreate Resource Reservation. Reservation Timeline. Microsoft Surface. You cannot drag with touch input a reservation on the timeline. Timeline drag-and-\ndrop supports only mouse events. (APP-3312)\nOutlook Plugin. My Reservations. When the Outlook Plugin displays the My Reservations, the popup is opened without the option to edit any of the\nreservations showed, so users cannot add resources. The Add Reservation button is also disabled. (AD-4846)\nGoogle Calendar Integration. When you have configured the application for \"no integration\" with Exchange, the .ics files that are generated to be imported into\nOutlook, Google Calendar, or any other calendar app, sometimes do not correctly update the Google Calendar application. Specifically, there can be a problem\nwith the file content related to the meeting identifiers created by the application. These meeting identifiers are not always unique. If you create a new calendar,\ninstead of importing an existing one, the creation of meetings seems to work correctly for single and recurring reservations, but updates and cancellations don\u2019t\nalways work as expected.\nSpace known limitations\nView and Print Floor Plan. If Room Category and Room Type have the same value, only one value is displayed in the drawing. (AD-10178)\nSpace Console. Advanced Filter. If you select two distinct floor plans (for example, AB01 and HQ18) and then filter by floors using the Advanced filter, the\nSpace Console will only show one floor. (AD-14674)\nSpace Console. Export What You See. If you select multiple floor plans to display, only the first displayed floor plan is exported. All visible floor plans should\nexport. (AD-12658)\nSpace Console. Bulk Editing Rooms. If you select from the floor plan more than 10 rooms and attempt to bulk-edit them, the form may not display all the fields\nand buttons making it difficult or impossible to edit the selected rooms. When editing rooms in bulk, edit fewer than 10 rooms at one time. (AD-2711)\nSpace Console. Generate Ad Hoc PDF. Large Drawings. For large drawings, such as one with an SVG size of 5590K, the report may not generate. In these\ncases, increase the memory, such as increasing the Tomcat memory to 2048 M. (AD-2048)\nSpace Console. Employees Tab. Selecting Employees. If you have a list of employees that runs over multiple pages, when you select employees and then\nmove to \"Next\" or \"Previous\" page, the selection will be cleared. As a workaround, you can first use the \"Place Employee in Waiting Room\" or \"Unassign\" action\nfor the selected employees on the current page, and then move to a different page to select additional employees. (AD-2741)\nSpace Console. Team Space. Organization Name Field. When assigning associations to teams, you will see that the Associations tab includes the\nOrganization Name field. This is validated by the Organizational Units (org) table. To create the values for the Organizational Units table so that they are\navailable when completing the Organization Name field, you must use the Smart Client. Create a new view that holds the org table and use this view to define\nyour organizational units. (3052882)\nSpace Console. Plan Types. Using Plan Types on the Space Console affords the user the ability to personalize highlights, text labels, and printed legends to\nthe deployment's needs, in addition to the pre-existing highlights and label options that exist on the Space Console's drop-down menus. The Add-In Manager\ndefines Plan Type highlights and labels by creating or modifying view files and datasources that are logged in the active_plantypes table. However, to make\nchanges or add legend datasources, in addition to defining those datasources in the view file that active_plantypes references, the Add-In manager must:\n\n1. Make an associated change in the same view file for a highlight datasource, and name it as the legend is named. For example, if the Add-In Manager\nmakes a legend datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend\", they must also make an associated highlight datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-\nhl-rm-by-dp-name_rmHighlight\".\n2. In the PDF export AXVW file ab-sp-console-export-drawing-pdf.axvw, the Add-in Manager must also create a legend-type panel and refer to the\nnew legend datasource. Following the same example, the panel's id must be named panel_ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend, and the\ndatasource must equal ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend. The fields that the datasource defines and that should be visible in the legend must\nbe defined in that panel. (3050005)\nSpace Requests. Moves. If you change the From Location in a space request, use Space / Moves / Move Coordinator / Complete Group Moves to close the\nmove, and check the rmpct record, you will see that the value for primary_em is still 0. It should change to 1 since user has changed the From Location from\nsatellite location to primary location. The conditions for this situation are: workspace transactions are enabled, the SLA for Group Move calls for the service\nprovider as Move Management and no approvers, and the application parameters are: InferRoomDepartments=0 and\nAssignUnallocatedSpace=ProrateFloor. (3043629)\nMoves. Action Questionnaires. If you add new Action Types (using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Types task), you cannot add\nquestionnaires to these new action types using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Questionnaires task. (3028382)\nMaintenance known limitations\nNon-English Locales. Tagging in Comments. When you tag someone in a comment using OnSite or Web Central, the system generates an email; under a\nnon-English locale, the strings in both email title and email body are not translated. Non-translated text includes: the string 'tagged you in work request' in both\nemail title and email body, as well as all the strings for work request parameters in email body. (AD-9394)\nTime Zones. You will encounter the wrong time zone in work orders (11:57 AM instead of 1:57 PM) if you select the \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value as the time zone using\nthe Define Geographical Locations view. Instead, select a city-specific time zone such as \"Europe/Paris timezone(UTC+1)\". The \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value will be\nremoved in the future as it is not necessary. (AD-8802)\nMaintenance Console. Sorting. The first time that you sort the Maintenance Console's grid by a field it correctly sorts; if you sort by the same fields multiple\ntimes, the sort does not work and the arrow in the header row does not update correctly. (AD-7932)\nCraftspersons. Notifications. For SLAs that are configured so craftspersons are to be notified when work is issued (notify craftsperson check-box), the\ncraftsperson is not receiving notification when the work is issued. (AD-4960)\nCraftsperson Sample Data. In the sample HQ project, there are many records in Craftspersons (cf) table that do not have email account; also many have\nduplicated email accounts like no-response@archibustgd.com. The key convention for the workflow is: cf.email=em.email=afm_users.email. These\nvalues must be unique. To fix this issue, just remove those records from the cf table for which emails are either empty or have duplicated value. Below are some\nsituations where duplicated values can cause problems\nLaunch SLA console, dispatch to supervisor, click Select Value, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_supervisor=1\nContinue to add a estimation step, select employee to do estimation, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_estimator=1\nLaunch the Maintenance Console, click any work request, click the Forward button, select supervisor, you will see all employees instead of all meeting the\nrestriction: cf.is_supervisor=1.(AD-6744)\nAssets known limitations\nAsset Lifecycle Console. Classification Filter. When you filter for a classification, in the Select Value list associated with the Classification filter, the\nClassifications tree expands automatically up to the second level. The returned classification results may be at lower levels, so you may need to manually\nexpand the tree to see everything. Ideally, the Asset Lifecycle Console would automatically expand to the appropriate level; however, it expands only to the\nsecond level due to potential performance issues on larger inventories of assets. ( AD-10324 )\nAsset Disposal Console. Inventory of Asset Systems report. Oracle only. The Inventory of Asset Systems report (available from the Reports button on the\nAsset Relationship Analysis tab) presents a workflow rule error if you are running on Oracle. (AD-14128)\nAsset Disposal Console. Changing Building Status from Asset Disposal Console Causes Inconsistencies in Real Estate. The Asset Disposal Console\nupdates the asset records for Buildings and Properties as well as inserts OT records to match when the asset is disposed of. REPM reports on Owned, Pipeline,\nand Disposed OT statuses for buildings, but ignores buildings with other ownership transaction statuses, or gives unexpected results in reports. The Real Estate\ndomain's Add/Edit Wizard does not have a way to modify the status of the bl record. Setting the transaction Status to Owner does not change the status of the\nbuilding to Owned. Coordinate OT records with asset status in both Real Estate and Disposal Console. (APP-852)\nDefine Classifications. Deleting Top Levels. In the Define Classification view (ab-ca-def-class.axvw, which is available from the Business Process\nOwner process of Asset Management, Condition Assessment, and Environmental Sustainability Assessment), you cannot delete a top level. Instead, you must\ndelete the top level by using Smart Client and deleting the record from the csi table. If you are not going to use a top-level classification hierarchy, it is advisable\nto delete all the child records (under the top level) before deleting the top level. (AD-6682)\nClassifications. Localization. Numeric ID (Automatic Lookup). The Classifications (csi) and Classification Standards (csi_std) tables are not translatable.\nTherefore, in order to use the Automatic Lookups (Numeric IDs) feature for asset classifications, enable Automatic Lookups for them without\nafm_scmpref.preferences. Otherwise, Archibus will look for the translatable fields in the two tables, resulting in application errors. Also, the Asset\nClassification Description field (csi.description) and the field Classification Standard Description (csi_std.description) are not translatable. If enabling\nthe Automatic Lookup for these fields, do not use the attribute displayType=\"translate\" because the fields are not translatable.(APP-4286) (AD-6683).\nEnterprise Assets known limitations\nProject Proposal Console. Baseline cost of a Billion Monetary Units or Greater. If you enter a baseline cost for an individual required asset that is a billion\nmonetary units or greater, you get an error that the value entered exceeds the maximum storage unit for the field. This is because the value for the baseline cost\nin the sb_items table is defined as numeric (9,1). However, the value you entered displays correctly in the grid and in the statistical summary because the value\nin the eq_req_items table is defined as numeric (16,2). This error occurs only in the rare case that the cost of an individual asset is a billion monetary units or\ngreater. (3052851)\nProject Proposal Console. Selected Period Fields not Displaying. The default selection is to display Baseline and Period 1. If you add other period fields but\nthen want to return to the default setting and find that the Console is not displaying your selection, clear your browser cache. (APP-1601)\nManage Reference Documents. This task enables you to associate a document with a Building Use, Property Type, and Furniture Standard. However, there is\ncurrently no way to view documents added for these items. It also enables you to associate a document with projects of different types. Currently, you are able to\nview documents for only projects that have the Scenario type. You are, however, able to view documents added for work request Problem Types, PM\nprocedures, and action items that are associated with a Proposed project. (3050281)\nAsset Portal known limitations\nView Equipment Plan. If you have a lot of asset symbols on the floor plan, they may not display the Equipment Code as asset text and may not be correctly\nfilled with color. (3028852)\nReal Property known limitations\nPortfolio known limitations\nLand Dashboard. Export. The Description and Country Code fields are not correctly exported to DOCX. (AD-13377)\nForecasting known limitations\nPortfolio Forecasting Wizard. Calculations. If the user units are different from the project units, when you calculate the area on the floor for an allocation event\nby multiplying headcount by average area per employee, the result can be off by a factor of 10.76. (3052105)\nStrategic Financial Analysis known limitations\nFinancial Analysis Console. VPA. The console does not load if the user has a VPA that is not compatible with the console restriction. Please see Adding VPA to\nthe Financial Analysis Console \u00a0for details on creating a VPA for this console. (3053673)\nSustainability &\u00a0Risk known limitations\n\nCompliance known limitations\nExtended Questionnaires. Service Requests from Mobile. Although the ability to create service requests from questionnaires was added to the Compliance\nSurveys mobile app, it has not yet been implemented in the Web Central Compliance application. Therefore, if a mobile questionnaire respondent provides\ndetails for a follow-up Service Request actions for any question in a questionnaire, then the respondent should take care to fully submit the questionnaire via the\nmobile app; they should not edit or submit via the Web Central questionnaire edit form because the Web Central edit form might not preserve the request details\nor set the status of the request as expected via the mobile app. (APP-4250)\nExtended Questionnaires. Assigned to Events. View my Events Calendar. The \"View My Events Calendar\" task for Compliance Program Coordinators does\nnot provide a link from events details to answer or review any questionnaires that might be attached to assigned events. The workaround is for Program\nCoordinators to use one of the other \"My... Events\" tasks to access assigned questionnaires. (APP-1667)\nExtended Questionnaires. Question Tree. Nodes without Child Records. In the Define Compliance Questionnaire view, when you examine a question that\nhas multiple choice answers, you will see that the Question Tree does not indicate that a node has no child content. When a node has no children, it still displays\nthe triangle-shaped icon for expanding and collapsing, giving the impression that there are child records. After you click the node, the triangle disappears until\nrefresh. (WC-2386)\nContracts and Compliance Programs with Cost Records. Deleting. You must first delete all assigned cost records associated with a contract or program or\nrequirement or term before you can delete the coordinating record. (APP-2276)\nHazard Abatement known limitations\nHomogeneous Areas not Highlighted. The application does not currently highlight all rooms identified as containing portions of homogeneous areas when\nthere are no assessments directly associated with those rooms. (APP-5240)\nWaste known limitations\nHazardous Waste Accumulation Report. The application stores and displays the hazardous waste accumulation volume limit application parameter value in\nunits of US Gallons. Users must take care to convert any other volume limit parameter into gallons if they adjust the application parameter controlling this. In any\ncase, the application does automatically and correctly convert the accumulated waste quantity to compare against this standard, no matter what units the waste\nhad been recorded in. (APP-5470)\nWaste Container Labels. The application generates formatted label documents for selected waste records. The web pop-up dialogue that shows the results of\nthe document creation has a bug limiting the display of outputted documents to 4 records. However, the application does still produce label documents for all the\nselected records as distinct files, named according to the waste record id number and saved to the .../WebCentral/schema/per-site/pdf-forms/[username] folder.\n(APP-5241)\nEnergy\u00a0known limitations\nProrating bills. Duplicate Bills. If you happen to enter duplicate bills for the same building and vendor with overlapping dates of service, and then attempt to\nauto-generate prorated bills, the application may encounter a duplicate primary key error when trying to generate one or more of the bill records. This is because\nthe resulting time periods will be the same, and the proration action will fail. (APP-5242, AD-924)\nConfigure Bill Processing. Excluded Bill Types. Archived Bills. The Configure Bill Processing view allows users to choose to exclude certain bill types from\nthe application's rules requiring bills to be archived in contiguous, ordered, monthly series. However, if an unusual situation occurs wherein a vendor account's\nutility bill type should change after some bills have already been archived, then the application will ignore a request to exclude the new bill type for new incoming\nbills for that vendor account. A work-around is to exclude both the old and new utility bill types from the monthly bill test. (APP-1855)\nProcess BAS Data View. The Web Central core does not yet support grid indexes on dates fields or on calculated fields. For example, if you create an index on\na date field having the value 2014-01-01, the value first shows as \u20182 \u2013 All.\u2019 If you click the \u20182\u2019 option, the value changes to \u201820\u2019; click the \u201820\u2019 and it's transformed to\n\u2018201\u2019; click the \u2018201\u2019 and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2019; click again, and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2026.\u2019 This issue appears in the right \u201cClean num\u201d panel in Energy\nManagement's Process BAS Data view. (WC-3108)\nView Prorated and Aggregated Bills. In rare cases, when the sum of aggregated bills exceeds a value 1000000 in the chosen display units, the application will\npresent an alert message stating that the value of the calculated field exceeds the field's maximum. In this view, the user may safely dismiss this message and\nproceed to view the bill record. (APP-5270)\nCapital Projects known limitations\nProjects known limitations\nProjects. Importing from Microsoft Project. From the Projects / Execute / Procure task / Import tab you can import an *.xml file from Microsoft Project.\nDepending on your version of Microsoft Project, you may need to choose to \u201cOpen as a new project.\" Otherwise, you may encounter errors with the\npredecessors values if you decide to append the data or merge the data. (3011985)\nProject Template. VPA. With VPA active, if you use the Projects / Set Up / Define Template Projects task to create a new

 project and enter a Project Type and\nTitle, you will find that the process fails and a template project is not created. As a work-around, add NULL to the Site VPA list; this allows a Project record to be\ngenerated. (AD-8105)\nConnectors known limitations\nReserved Words. Archibus does not support field names with reserved words. For example, adding the field \"alter\" to the table bl, causes the Archibus\napplication server to fail to start when attempting to restart it. Therefore, the INBOUND use case of importing data into an Archibus table that has a field named\nwith a reserved word is not supported. The OUTBOUND use case of exporting data to a remote system like BUILDER SMS that has a database field that uses a\nreserved word (ex. order) is supported. (APP-3975)(APP-4769)\nEDI Example. The example file provided for the EDI connector in the HQ project demonstrates Web Central\u2019s ability to process EDI data formats, but only\naddresses the bill table. Since the example lacks a bill_lines connector definition and a bill connector association, it is not possible to fully load a complete utility\nbill using the EDI connector example. In the future, we plan to make a new example that is more realistic available for download. (3047882)\nBackslash Character. In some environments entering \\\\ in connector field parameters or connector parameters may result in the \\\\ being saved as \\. As a\nworkaround, for a field enter \\\\\\\\ for \\\\ every time you save the field. For connector parameters, avoid use of \\\\; or, use \\\\\\\\ and fix configuration in post\nprocess. (3045250, 3047842)\nSaving. Saving a connector does not display the standard \u201cRecord Successfully Saved\u201d banner. (3045250)\nExtensions for BUILDERTM SMS known limitation\nAsset Attributes. Numeric Values. Separators. When entering numerical values for an asset attribute (ex. Quantity) do not enter a numeric separator such as\na comma. If a comma is entered in the asset attribute value as a numeric separator, the connector framework will not know how to process the comma and the\ndata transfer to BUILDER SMS will fail. (APP-5603)\nOutbound Connector. Condition Assessment Items. The master outbound connector SMS_ARCHIBUS_BUILDER_Inspect exports all condition assessment\nitems for a given section with date assessed in the past 90 days or within the number of days from current date set in the application parameter\nAbCapitalPlanningCA-BUILDER_InspectionDate_NewerThan and not only the most recent condition assessment record for the that section and for that\ntime interval. (APP- 4090)\nInbound Connectors. Number of Buildings. Sites do not record number of buildings transferred in from BUILDERTM SMS for the specific site. (APP-2401)\nInbound Connectors. Sections. Sections measured in pieces with quantity higher than 1 will not be split into multiple pieces of equipment when imported into\nArchibus. When transferring sections from BUILDERTM SMS measured in pieces and that have a quantity larger than one, Archibus does not create multiple\npieces of equipment. It creates only one piece of equipment with the corresponding value for the quantity attribute. (APP-2138)\nOutbound Connectors. Organizations and Sites. For new organizations and new sites transferred from Archibus to BUILDERTM SMS, the OUTBOUND\nconnectors do not set values to these BUILDERTM SMS fields:\nOrganization.UpdateCosts\nOrganization.UpdateCurves\n\nOrganization.ORG_ACF\nOrganization.ORG_SEISMICZONE\nOrganization.ORG_CI\nOrganization.ORG_FI\nOrganization.ORG_PI\nOrganization.ORG_FCI\nBUILDERTM SMS displays new organizations as new sites transferred from Archibus to BUILDERTM SMS, even without setting values to the above fields.\nBUILDERTM SMS users can enter the values for these fields using the BUILDERTM SMS interface. Running the OUTBOUND master connector a second time\nwill not affect the values entered by BUILDERTM SMS users for these fields.

After cataloging rooms, BIM Managers can view a list of all cataloged rooms. (AD-10742)\nChanges in Platform\nChanges in Smart Client, Smart Client Extensions for CAD and Revit\nSmart Client Extension for Revit\nRooms. Mapping to Revit. Room Code is now automatically filled in when Archibus Rooms are mapped to Revit Spaces. (AD-14073)\nRooms. Linked Models. The rm_id is now recognized when cataloging the Equipment Items from an MEP model linking back to an ARCHITECTURAL model.\nThe workaround of cataloging the equipment from the Architectural model using the BIM Explorer is no longer necessary. (AD-14277)\nParameters. Fixed an issue where when mapping parameters to the database, the mapping where being duplicated or not saved. (AD-15161)\nPublish 3D. Publish 3D is now compatible with Autodesk Revit 2024 . (AD-15746)\nSmart Client Extension for CAD\n\nPublishing. Metric format. Fixed multiple issues with publishing in Metric format that previously resulted in some elements either being published\ndisproportionate or not being published at all. (AD-13041, AD-13622, AD-13657, AD-14511)\nSmart Client\nThere were no code changes to Smart Client for V.2023.04.\nChanges in Mobile Framework and Mobile Apps\nThere were no code changes for the Mobile framework and mobile apps for V.2023.04.\nChanges in Database\nSee Database Schema Revision History.\nChanges in the System\nConfiguration\nImplemented support for add-in applications when restrictLoadingOfUnassignedViews is enabled (AD-14567)\nAuthentication\nAddressed issue signing in to workplace directly when using SSO and having set useSingleSessionForConcurrentUsers (AD-11342)\nLibraries\nUpgraded Aspose to 23.5 (AD-13020)\nUpgraded netty to version 4.1.94 (AD-15378)\nRemoved JCache library (AD-15567)\nUpgraded spring-hateoas to version 2.1.2 (AD-15625)\nUpgraded spring-security to version 5.8.3 (AD-15626)\nUpgraded com.squareup.okio to version 3.4.0 (AD-15627)\nUpgraded json to version 20230618 (AD-15883)\nUpgraded spring-boot-autoconfigure to version 2.7.15 (AD-15884)\nUpgraded Node.js to v20.7.0 (AD-16201)\nLocalization\nAdded translations for missing languages in Reports Central (AD-15498)\nUpdated translation DUW scripts and generated Web Central language files for v2023.04 (AD-16018; AD-16122)\nSecurity\nIncreased resiliency against SQLi (AD-11589; AD-14371; AD-14720; AD-15166; AD-15341; AD-15545; AD-15575; AD-15691; AD-15692; AD-15693; AD-15702;\nAD-15718; AD-15725; AD-15754; AD-15772; AD-15773; AD-15774; AD-15776; AD-15777; AD-15778; AD-15788)\nIncreased resiliency against XSS (AD-15101; AD-15102; AD-15299)\nIncreased resiliency against Path Traversal (AD-15383; AD-15635; AD-15638; AD-15640)\nIncreased security of Web Central interoperation with SC Extensions (AD-15222; AD-15483; AD-15532; AD-15574; AD-15608)\nAdded items to the list of valid OGNL expressions (AD-15347; AD-15359)\nImplemented flag to disable loading views with unsafe data sources (AD-14982)\nAdded configuration option restricting where connectors could write files to (AD-15044)\nRemoved default APP_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD (AD-15381)\nRemoved hardcoded credentials (AD-15382)\nAddressed issue with loading of unassigned views (AD-15385)\nEnabled encryption between the MSSQL DBMS and application server by default by using the trustServerCertificate property (AD-15519)\nModified content of log messages to increase security (AD-15915)\nSystem\nImplemented echoing JWT token into Archibus log when token processing fails (AD-14272)\nAddressed issue with detecting dependencies when restricting loading of unassigned views or finding data sources (AD-15142)\nAddressed issue with setting user passwords (AD-15856)\nAddressed issue with loadDataSourceFromFile WFR (AD-15860)\nExcluded saml-users.sql from the root of WebCentral WAR (AD-15862)\nCorrected reference to snyk plugin (AD-15871)\nDatabase\nCorrected precision of latitude and longitude fields (AD-15504)\nData Sources\nAdded ${sql.mainTable} to the list of valid OGNL expressions (AD-14700)\nAddressed issue with setting data source array parameters (AD-15816)\nAddressed issue with bind variables specifying date and time in Oracle dbms (AD-15878)\nApplications\nEnhanced synchronizing with Google Calendar (AD-14718)\nAddressed issue with location of rooms on floor plans (AD-15089)\nAddressed issue with loading column reports (AD-15671)\nImproved view loading performance by switching off SQL validation queries (AD-15760)\nReports Central\nAdded data transfer out (AD-5354)\nAdded export to Word (AD-5355)\nAddressed incorrect logic for \u201cbetween\u201d clauses (AD-12751)\nExtract-Transfer-Load (ETL)\nImprove logging of exception messages in connector log (AD-5636)\nCorrected scale of texts in furniture blocks on drawings exported to PDF (AD-14324)\n\nAddressed issue with blank page being rendered to PDF for SVGs with area exceeding 200 million square pixels (AD-13070; AD-14839)\nCorrected export of work requests to XLS (AD-15470)\nImproved rendering of SVGs exported from the Space Console to PDF (AD-15503)\nChanges in Workplace\nSign in. SSO. The following has been resolved: If you have set up Web Central for request header SSO and enabled\nUseSingleSessionForConcurrentUsers in security.properties, if you attempt to access [WEB CENTRAL URL]/archibus/workplace/ directly, you\nare not able to log in. You must first access Web Central and then load Workplace from there. Similarly, if you load Workplace, copy the URL, close the browser\nwithout signing out, open a new browser and paste the URL, you will not be able to log in. (AD-11342, AD-12854)\nPerformance. If you are booking a workspace on a floor with many permanent seats, you will notice improved performance. (AD-15991)\nCustomization. New External Libraries. Due to code changes, customers must follow a new procedure if they wish to customize Workplace by adding new\nlibraries. See https://help.archibus.com/system/sysman.htm#workplace/library.htm\nBooking for Multiple Employees. For both workspace bookings and meeting space bookings, we have made improvements to the methodology for booking for\nmultiple employees.(AD-14228)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nUser Interface Consistencyy. When adding a location to a service request when a floor plan is not available, you will notice that the button and the pop-up form\nboth say \"Search for location.\" Previously, the pop-up form and button did not have the same text. (AD-14403)\nScrolling and Extra Spaces. There are no longer improper empty spaces above the header and below the footer. There are no longer two redundant scroll bars\nthat appear when it is impossible to scroll up or scroll down. (AD-13929)\nQR Codes. From QR Code page, it is no longer difficult to navigate to the login screen. (AD-9681)\nWorkspace Bookings. Room List. Sort By. The Room Code/Room Name field title is no longer partially hidden behind the select value drop-down arrow.\nFunctionality was not impeded, as a selection could still be made. (AD-15045)\nWorkspace Bookings. Select Occupants. If you tried to book six or more staff for working space, the UI could not correctly display you selected employees.\nThis has been corrected. (AD-8599)\nMeeting Space Recurring Reservations. Setting Times. When you tried to set the time for the recurring reservation, the marker and the keyboard displayed\nvery briefly and then immediately disappeared again, leaving you unable to delete or type any values. This has been corrected. The workaround was: Use the\nCalendar icon to select the desired date. Note: This behavior does not occur when you attempt to edit the Dates on the Search Meeting Spaces filter or when\nentering a Move Request. There, it behaves as expected and editing is possible. (AD-15015)\nService Request. Large Attachments. Alert Message. If you attempt to attach a file larger than 2MB, Workplace now presents a message stating that the file\nis too large. (AD-15110, AD-15259)\nService Request. Photos. The following is no longer an issue: Create a new service request and add a photo; when you open the request via My Requests or\nWeb Central, you will see that the photo is not attached to the service request. (AD-13011)\nService Request. Uploading Both Images and Documents. It is now possible to upload both camera images and other file types from the device in the same\nservice request. (AD-13309, AD-13928)\nAndroid Tablet. Unsupported File Types. The following issue is resolved: When running the Workplace mobile app on an Android tablet, you will find that if you\nselect an supported file type to add to a service request, Workplace does not display a message instructing you that the file type is not supported. No file is\nadded and the screen remains the same as before any selection was made. Note: With permissions not allowed (selection drawer does not display), the\nmessage does display on selecting an unsupported file type. (AD-15056)\nAndroid Tablet. QR Scan. In the Workplace Mobile app running on an Android tablet, the URL generated by the room QR scan no longer takes you to\nWorkplace Dashboard view; instead, you go to the room\u2019s booking view. (This is the view that opens when the generated URL is copied to -and opened in device\nbrowser.) (AD-13986)\nChanges in Maintenance\nNon-English Locales. Tagging in Comments. When you tag someone in a comment using OnSite or Web Central, the system generates an email; under a\nnon-English locale, the strings in both email title and email body are now correctly translated. Previously, non-translated text included: the string 'tagged you in\nwork request' in both email title and email body, as well as all the strings for work request parameters in email body. (AD-9394)\nMaintenance Console: Work Requests Details. This form has the ability to add standardized problem resolution descriptions by choosing from a list of pre-\ndefined Problem Resolution Codes. Maintenance managers can define their own Problem Resolution Codes and descriptions. (AD-14405)\nMaintenance Console: Work Requests Details. Tools panel. The Show Reservations pop-up displays additional fields that are useful for reserving tools: Date\nScheduled, Time Scheduled and Scheduled Hours. (AD-14822)\nMaintenance Console. Listing Work Requests. In the case that a work request has multiple assignments and/or work logs for a craftsperson, the Maintenance\nConsole no longer displays the same work request multiple times. (AD-14444)\nChanges in Workplace Services\nExtension for Exchange Integration. Room Calender Monitoring. We have corrected a problem in which if you created a new recurring reservation from\nOutlook Web Access for at least three occurrences by inviting a room (e.g. HQ-17-109), and you later changed the second occurrence, the second occurrence\nwas correctly recorded. However, if you then changed the third occurrence, the original third occurrence was correctly processed, but the new reservation\ncreated for the second occurrence was changed to match the date of the third occurrence. Thus, the room was no longer booked for the second occurrence. (AD-\n15792)\nExtension for Exchange Integration. Out-of-date Error. When updating a reservation and meeting from Web Central, the update in Exchange sometimes fails\ndue to an out-of-date error. We have added an automated retry when this error occurs.(AD-14906)\nExchange Listener. Case-insensitive Email Comparison. Email addresses sometimes exist with camel case or other forms in Exchange, which can cause\nonboarding issues for Exchange calendar monitoring, if the email addresses are not identical in the Archibus database. Email comparison is now case-\ninsensitive for the Exchange Listener. The change enables you to use different casing for the email addresses of room mailboxes and meeting organizers\nbetween Web Central and Exchange, on both MS SQL and Oracle. This change impacts all Exchange integration functionality.(AD-15079)\nReservations Plugin for Microsoft Outlook. DotNetBrowser. We have made improvements to ensure that the Outlook Plugin can be used if the\nDotNetBrowser fails. We have also improved the logging .DotNetBrowser logs are now written to the subfolder DotNetBrowser in the Outlook Plugin log folder,\nconfigured in ArchibusOutlookPlugin.Logging.config. The default location is: %appdata%\\ARCHIBUS\\{version}\\OutlookPlugin\\DotNetBrowser. (AD-15224)\nReservations Application. Recurring Reservations. We have corrected a problem with recurring daily reservations that have a time period of more than 100\ndays. (AD-12548)\nReservations Application. Reservations Calendar Console. If the Building Code, Floor Code, or Room Code value contained extra spaces, the Console\ncould not find this room on the floor plan. We have corrected this problem. We replaced the drawing control used in the room information popup with the a Asset\nDrawing Control. (AD-11654, AD-11908)\nChanges in Real Property\nLease Portfolio Console. Configure Fields. You can now use the Configure Fields option to create your own fields for lease information, as well as promote\nexisting, stock database fields. Access Configure Fields in the following forms of the Lease Portfolio Console.\u00a0(AD-15059, AD-15051).\nAdd New Lease form\nEdit Lease form\nLease Portfolio Console. Select Fields. The Lease Console now includes the Select Fields command (gear icon) so that you can position, hide, and display\npromoted and user-defined fields, as well as the other fields of the Leases table. (AD-15058)\n\nChanges in Sustainability & Risk\nSDS and Material Details by Location task. The view now properly loads without errors. (AD-15671)\nXLS Export. We have fixed a problem invoking the XLS button in the following views. (AD-16088)\nCompliance / Compliance Program Manager / Manage Document Library [ab-comp-library.axvw]\nCompliance / Compliance Program Manager / View Unscheduled Compliance Items [ab-comp-unscheduled.axvw]\nCompliance / Operational Report / Compliance Requirements [ab-comp-rpt-requirement.axvw]\nEmergency Preparedness / Documentation /Manage Document Library [ab-ep-library.axvw]\nChanges in Capital Project Management\nEvaluate Scenario Funding (ab-evaluate-scenario-by-fund.axvw). As part of our vulnerability remediation for FedRAMP certification, we updated this file for\npotential SQL injection issues.(AD-15260)\nProject Management Console. The upper left panel of the Project Dashboard now correctly displays information about the project such as Project Name,\nProject Type, and Project Status. (AD-15124)\nArchibus\u00a0Help known limitations\nNon-English help from the Navigator. If you use the right-click Help command on a Navigator process, you will receive an error message that the topic cannot\nbe found. This is because the localized version of Archibus Help does not contain topics at this level of detail. In a future release, the right-click Help command\nwill load the appropriate topic from the English version of Archibus Help. (AD-2786)\nArchibus SaaS known limitations\nHome Page Publishing. SaaS Partner Administrator. If you sign in as a SaaS Partner Administrator (such as sample user AFM-BP), run the System / SaaS\nPartner Administrator / Manage Home Pages and Processes task, modify a home page, and publish your changes; you receive an error message. As a\nworkaround: use System / Add-In Manager / Publish Home Pages by Role to publish home pages after modifying them. (APP-6426)\nNavigator for AFM-MOD Sample User. If you sign in to the HQ sample project as AFM-MOD, you will notice that the Navigator groups modules into domains\n(including the Archibus SaaS domain) so that the Navigator presents four levels. Having some modules grouped under the Archibus SaaS domain may be\nconfusing if you are demonstrating or learning the product. This change is a result of the Healthcare module being added to the Navigator and the Navigator now\nexceeding 13 modules. This can be resolved by removing a module that you do not need. (AD-12985)\nOnSite mobile app known limitations\nManage Configurations for OnSite task. The Save message does not dismiss and prevents you from moving to other tabs; this message displays even if you\nhave not made any changes. As a workaround, access the OnSite parameters using the System / Archibus Administrator - Application Configuration / Configure\nApplication Parameters task and restrict to the AbOnSiteMobile application. (AD-15513)\nAndroid. Accessing Documents. If you attempt to open a DOCX file linked to a work request on an Android phone, you receive an error message. This is a\nresult of the phone not having an app to open DOCX files. You can install an app for this purpose. (ON-1495)\nNotifications. Chinese. Push notifications are not yet supported for Chinese. (ON-1058)\nNotifications. Oracle. With an Oracle deployment, you cannot receive notification from OnSite; if you check the Web Central Notifications Log view, you will not\nsee any messages sent from OnSite. (ON-1237)\nNew Requests. Cannot See. After you create a new request, you may not see it in the Request List because it is added to the end of the request list. You can\nuse the pull-to-refresh feature to re-sort the requests according to the \u201corder by\u201d option.(ON-487)\nWork Request List. Updating. When you create a new request, it is added to the bottom of the list because the sort order of work requests is not updating to\nreflect a new request. Pulling to refresh solves this issue.(ON-723)\nWorkplace known limitations\nLogo. In mobile and when accessibility mode is enabled, the \"Archibus by Eptura\" logo does not display. (AD-15759)\nWayfinding. UX Issues. When you select the Wayfinding icon, the \u201cReturn to Workplace\u201d button should display; upon selecting it, you should return to the page\nfrom which the Wayfinding icon was selected. However, the Cancel button appears or multiple buttons appear.\u00a0Additionally, on some devices, the header part of\nthe view overlaps the device\u2019s display info (time, connection, battery power etc), causing the app to look cluttered. (AD-16170)\nAccessibility Mode. Mobile Browser. If you are running Workplace in a mobile browser and have set Workplace to Accessibility mode, the available meeting\nrooms and working space rooms should display in List view; instead, the floor plan is displaying. Note that this works correctly in the desktop browser. (AD-16195)\nQR Code Landing Page. Mobile Browser. If you are running Workplace in a mobile browser and scan a QR\u00a0code, Workplace does not show all the request\ndetails on the QR code landing page list of recent requests. (AD-15967)\nRooms. Selecting from Floor Plan. When you click on a room in the floor plan to select it, you might experience that Workplace does not fully highlight the\nroom border. This can occur for both meeting room and workspace selection. (AD-14874)\nTablet. iPad Pro. People & Places. UI. The email address in the right panel is not properly displayed. (AD-9466)\nTablet. iPad pro/Safari. SSO If you start Workplace in a Safari browser and without signing out, you close the web browser window fully and then reopen the\nweb browser window and attempt to navigate to Workplace again, you will not be able to start Workplace. To work around the issue, clear the browser cache and\nreopen the browser. Or, open the browser, close the Workplace tab which is stuck, open a new tab and enter a Web Central or Workplace URL. This was tested\non iOS 16.2. (AD-12878)\nTablet. iPad Pro/Safari. The header is truncated, and on some pages cuts off buttons. This occurs in both landscape and portrait modes. (AD-13718)\nWorking Space Reservations\nFloor Plan Showing Booked Rooms. Hovering Over Booked Room. When you book a workspace and then return to the floor plan and hover over the\nselected room, the floor plan incorrectly shows the room as still available. As a workaround, you can select the room or first click outside the pop-up and then\nhover over the room; these actions will reflect the booking and show the correct availability. (AD-16035)\nSearch for Future Dates . When you book a workspace and then use the window on the right to select any other future day and click Search, you will find that\nthe results show the room as booked on future dates even though it is not booked. When you actually click the room, it does show the correct data. Note that if\nyou book a room for another employee, the room correctly shows as available on a future date.(AD-16024)\nSearch. Buildings without Floor Plans. From the People and Places screen, if you search for a building that does not have floor plans and then subsequently\nload a floor plan and search for workspace rooms to book, the floor plan will not show booked workspace rooms. As a workaround, switch to the list view and\nback to the floor plan or press CTRL + F5. The booked rooms will now correctly show on the floor plan. (AD-15932)\nQR Codes. When booking a working space from a QR landing page without signing in, you will find that the number of spaces available for booking is indicated\nas \"undefined.\" As you continue with the booking, you will see that no bookings display in the calendar or Workspace bookings list. However, if you check Web\nCentral\u2019s Review Bookings view, you will see that the booking is successfully made. (AD-15948)\nMeeting Room Reservations\nSearch. UX. When you click on the Select button in \"Search meeting spaces - Meeting time\" form, when you switch between Any and Select , the blue outline\ngets hidden partially.(AD-13670)\nCancel. Meeting Attendees. If you add attendees to a meeting, cancel the reservation, and then choose another room, on the \"Booking Space For\" form, the\nattendees that you previously selected are selected for the second reservation. The previously selected attendees should no longer be selected. The workaround\nis to deselect these attendees and continue with the booking. (AD-16058)\nAccessibility Mode. Room Name is not shown on the Meeting Space Booking Details page when accessed with accessibility mode enabled. (AD-15817)\n\nAccessibility Mode. In accessibility mode, if you edit a single meeting room booking, you cannot select the desired start time/duration values and you receive a\nmessage that your change is not saved. (AD-14711)\nQR\u00a0Codes.On Meeting Room QR code pages, the \"Skip\" button does not work. Specifically, this sequence does not work: scan a QR code, in the browser tap\nWorkplace button to return to the Workplace dashboard. Next, on the log-in pop up, tap \u201cSkip\u201d. No action occurs. Note that the same steps on equipment QR\ncode and workspace QR code pages work fine. (AD-16222)\nPre and Post Block Times. If you search for a meeting room with a given time frame, select an available room, and then change the meeting time so that it\noverlaps with an existing meeting's pre and post block times, you can still reserve the room despite the overlapped pre or post block times. Likewise, if you are\nbooking recurring meetings, you can book meeting times that overlap with pre and post block times of existing meetings. (AD-14709, AD-14707)\nPre and Post Block Times. Scroll Bar. The scroll bar is hidden in the timeline slider when pre and post block times are specified for the room. As a result, you\ncannot select from 5 PM onward. (AD-16057)\nMultiple Room Configurations. In Workplace, we assume that only one configuration and one room arrangement has been defined for a room. If you create\nmultiple room configurations with the Reservations application, the configurations will appear in Workplace, but there is no distinguishing information about the\nconfigurations and the user will not know which space they are reserving. There will also appear to be a discrepancy between the available room count and the\nnumber of rooms shown on the floor plan. (AD-835, APP-5194, APP-5845)\nRecurrence Pattern. Workspace reservations do not show recurrence patterns in the details view. You can only delete a single occurrence at a time. AD-835)\nTime Slots. Meeting space requests do not honor the value of the parameter in AbWorkplaceReservations-MinutesTimeUnit. You can only select time\nintervals in 30-minute blocks. (AD-7010)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nQR\u00a0Codes. If a Workplace mobile app user is not logged in and they scan a QR code for room or equipment, the QR code landing page should display; instead,\nthe mobile app URL screen displays. (AD-16218)\nNavigation When Re-opening Workplace. Upon closing and re-opening the Workplace mobile app, you will be taken to the sign-in page instead of the home\npage. (AD-14752)\nQR Codes. The Home button is not available after scanning a QR code. (AD-9659)\nSigning In. Android. Version of Mobile Client. You cannot log in if you are not using Mobile Client 4.0. As a workaround, upgrade to Mobile Client 4.0. (AD-6801)\nWorkspace Bookings. Multiple Employees. If you book workspaces for more than 3 or 4 employees, the booking card of last employee is slightly hidden so\nthat you cannot see the complete name. Closing the \"Open in App\" banner will make the booking card fully visible. (AD-14904)\nWeb Central known limitations\nBinding Variables. Oracle. For FedRAMP compliance, binding variables for date and time parameters have been replaced with conversion expressions. We\nhave replaced the following with strings: date parameters with TO_DATE() expression and time parameters with TO_TIMESTAMP() expression. Replacing with\nstrings works only for MSSQL; Oracle will throw and error. (AD-15878)\nExport to XLS. Views with Export to XLS commands that use a Verbatim datasource and have printRestriction set to True, can give an error and export a\nlimited set of data. Setting printRestriction to False in the view works around the issue. (AD-14799)\nSelect Values. Floors. For 2.0 views that have a filter that includes the Floor Code field, the view may not show all available floors. The root cause is that the\ncore UI grid control determines the number of pages based on the number of index records. For the Floor selector, the index uses the Building Code, i.e. there\nare 111 buildings with floors. Thus, the grid shows only two pages of floor records (one page = 100 records). (AD-3706)\nQuestionnaires. Non-English. Questionnaires, such as those in Condition Assessment and Sustainability Assessment, do not allow assessors to edit out-of-\nthe-box, sample questions that have been localized from English (US) to other languages. The workaround is for Archibus Administrators to use Archibus Smart\nClient to edit the text of these sample questions. This issue affects only sample data questionnaires that have been localized from English. (AD-1547)\nExtended Questionnaires. Document/Photo. The Web Central questionnaire form (for both Compliance and Maintenance) does not currently support\nrespondent-initiated submission of more than one document/photo attachment per question, whether or not the questionnaire designer specifies a value greater\nthan 1 for Maximum Number Responses. The mobile app does support this feature. You cannot delete the uploaded document after Save the question-answer;\nthere is no action when clicking the X button. A questionnaire designer should take this into account when designing forms. (APP-2426, AD-4431)\nIf the intended respondents will be using Web Central to submit documents and flexibility in number of document responses is desired, then the designer\ncan work around the limitation by defining a parent question containing a follow-up question of type document and allow multiple instances of the parent\nquestion.\nFor example, parent question could be multiple choice \"attach a document?\" Yes/No. If Yes, then the application shows the document question as a\nfollow-up. Set up the \"Attach a document\" question to allow multiple answers, such that the respondent can add another, answer \"Yes\" and so on.\nHome Page Editor. Maps. When creating home pages, you add only one map bucket to each home page. (WC-2790)\nHome Pages. Localized. For some international users, home pages may display English titles for columns in the Metric Trends panel. If this issue occurs, the\nuser can switch to a different home page and go back, or sign out and sign in again. (WC-2373)\nGrid. Export To XLS/DOC. Smart Search Console. When you use the Smart Search Console (mini-console) to filter and then try to export the grid, you receive\na message that you are unable to export to Excel or Doc. (AD-14070)\nGrid. Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) Fields. If working with a view in which you define highlight patterns (such as Space / Space Inventory / Background\nData / Define Division and Department Highlight Patterns, ab-sp-create-dp-hatch.axvw), and you set a gradient highlight, create a swatch bitmap, and refresh the\nview, the Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) field will not correctly show the swatch bitmap for the gradient highlight. Instead, the fields show the same color for all\ngradient highlight definitions. (WC-2748)\nGrid 3.0. Grid Control 3.0, which is used in views such as PM Planner (ab-pm-planner.axvw) and Service Console (ab-request-console.axvw), presents an error\nif you try to sort by a field that is not from the main table. (AD-8474)\nView Titles. Menu Options Hidden. When a view title is too long, the top menu actions (User Menu, User Help, Add to Favorites) and client logo are not visible.\n(AD-4820)\nSchema Change Wizard. Oracle. When using Schema Change Wizard on an Oracle database, you may face the error ORA-01031: insufficient privileges when\nchoosing to re-create any of the Archibus security tables: afm_users; afm_groups. Resolution: Choose \"Alter existing table structures (preserves additional\nfields)\" option when trying to update afm_users/afm_groups tables. (3045736)\nSmart Client known limitations\nNavigator. With a non-SaaS license, logging in to the Smart Client as AFM incorrectly produces a Navigator that includes an Archibus SaaS process. (AD-3794)\nNavigator. Non-English Locale. If you launch Web Central from the Smart Client and are using a non-English locale, the Web Central Navigator will not display\nyour applications and tasks. (AD-3866)\nSAML. Connecting to SAML requires user to make server selection on subsequent sign-ins. (AD-1996)\nCertificate Authentication. Web Central Tasks. Cannot data transfer or launch Web Central if Certificate Authentication is in effect. (SMAR-626)\nEditing Standards Tables. If you edit Furniture Standards or Equipment Standards with the default database, the titles for the Length and Width fields will show\nincorrectly as \"ft\" or \"M\". If you log in with a different locale (e.g. view an Imperial project as a Metric user) the program will convert the values. The condition also\noccurs in Furniture or Equipment Standards views loaded in Web Central. To avoid this condition in both environments, load the Archibus Fields table (afm_flds),\nfind the Length and Width fields, and change their Numeric Format from \"Length\" to \"Default\". (3037311)\nDeleting a Record with a date/time Field as Part of its Primary Key. You are unable to delete records from tables that have a date/time field as part of the\nprimary key, such as the ehs_medical_mon_results table. There are no such errors when deleting records from the same table in Web Central views. (WC-2169)\nDeleting. hwr and hwo Tables. It is not possible to delete records from Smart Client grid views that present these tables. As a work-around, delete the records\nfrom Web Central. (SMAR-596)\nDeleting. Bulk Editing. Currently there is no way of bulk deleting data from Smart Client. If you select all records and then hit Delete, only those records\ncurrently displayed on screen are deleted; all of the other records that are selected but not on screen remain. As a work-around, in View Definition Wizard, create\na single panel interactive report for the table in question, choose only the primary key field(s) unless you need to add a restriction. In the preview pane, enable\n\nadvanced editing, and add multipleSelectionEnabled=\u201dtrue\u201d in the panel, then insert a panel action with a command type deleteSeletedRows.\nSave Changes and preview the view and you can check all and delete right from the preview, without needing to save/publish it. (SMAR-17)\nRibbon. The Smart Client ribbon is very small on high resolution monitors. (SMAR-503)\nGrid. Refresh when Filtering. After you set and clear a filter, the grid does not correctly update record counts and refresh. As a workaround, run the Clear\naction on the menu ribbon. (SMAR-609)\nReplace Column. When there are more than two tables in the standard role attached to the Smart Client grid view, the command presents errors. (SMAR-528)\nModified Views Cannot be Saved as the Default View. Log in as a user that has the Security group SYS-VIEW-ALTER (such as AFMX), open a view, change\nthe view, save, and make it the default view. Reload, and the default view will not reflect your changes. (SMAR-329)\nExplorer pane. Recent Views List. When you create new views and save them in the Explorer's list of recent views, you can save up to 8 views. When you\nsave the ninth view, the system removes the newest view from the list. It should remove the oldest view from the list. (SMAR-907)\nData Transfer. Dates deleted from the output file are not cleared in the database after transferring in the file with the changes made. (SMAR-671)\nSmart Client Extension for AutoCAD\u00a0known limitations\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nQuery Table. The Query Table command does not include fields that contribute to the primary key; for example, it does not show the Building Code and Floor\nCode values for rooms. (SMAR- 798)\nHighlighting commands\nUnclosed polylines. If some areas don't highlight with solid highlights, they might be open not closed polylines. If so, close them. The AutoCAD solids\ndon't fill unclosed-closed polylines. AutoCAD hatch patterns do, however. Notice that if you have multiple areas of one type (e.g. Office standard), having\none unclosed polyline may cause others to also not have a solid fill (since Archibus hatches many of them in one go for efficiency's sake). (3030818)\nHatch patterns. The Archibus-defined patterns (from the .pat file) are not being loaded into AutoCAD at the time of highlighting. Only the out-of-the-box\nAutoCAD patterns work as expected because the highlighting logic defaults to a SOLID hatch pattern if it can't find the pattern definition. (SMAR-902)\nLarge floor plans. When dealing with very large floor plans (3,500 rooms on a single floor), commands like Catalog Layer and Highlight by Department do not\ngive progress feedback, but function correctly.\nAsset Text Height. The Smart Client Extension ignores the atxt_ht_in and atxt_ht_cm in favor of the atxt_ht value, which is in inches. For metric drawings the\nSCE converts this to cm. (SMAR-189)\nEdit Data. Suite areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0.\nIf you press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nTrial layers. Asset text. Asset text is left-justified instead of center-justified. (SMAR-492)\nExplorer window. Anchoring. When you open a drawing from within the Smart Client drawings list, the Explorer window should be positioned according to the\nsettings made in the previous session; instead, it opens in the floating position and you must reset it. (SMAR-702)\nDrawing Publishing\u00a0\nAutoCAD Leader objects. EMF does not support arrows or text with the leaders. SVG supports only solid arrows. (3044919)\nSecondary circulation areas as regions. As documented in\nhttps://www.archibus.net/ai/abizfiles/v23_help/archibus_help/user_en/archibus.htm#../Subsystems/webc/Content/web_user/space/concepts/open_plan.htm,\nyou can draw accurate polylines for secondary circulation using AutoCAD REGIONS. Publishing these drawings may result in rooms being set incorrectly\nin front of or behind other rooms. In order for rooms within a secondary circulation region to be shown and highlighted in front of the secondary circulation\nspace in a published drawing, they must be numbered higher than the secondary circulation space. (3051186)\nXREF The XREF Layer does not publish when the TURNOFFALL* value is specified in the additional layers field. As a workaround, turn off layers\nindividually and do not use the TURNOFFALL* feature to control XREF Layers.(SMAR-1001)\nAFM_NET_LISP \"Publish\" command. Ignores the viewWindow attribute when the publishType is EMF and the generated file is published to extents.\n(SMAR-737).\nSVG. Background Color. If you set the Set the ColorMapping field to BLACK for AbPubBackground in the sample HQ database and publish, the black\nbackground does not appear to take effect. This is because there are multiple active rules in the database, and later results overwrite the earlier ones. To\nresolve this either (a) set the Active flag to No for all of the SVG files except for one; or, (b) specify a unique Rule Suffix (e.g. -bl, -reg, -eq) for each rule,\nexcept for the one that has a Color Mapping value so that different rules will produce different output files. (SMAR-417)\nSVG. Hatches. Complex hatches, meaning that there are multiple polylines that are used as the boundaries for the hatch, do not publish to SVG; whereas\nhatches that do successfully publish are contained in a single polyline. You can separate the hatches using HATCHEDIT, and the publishing will work as\nexpected. (SMAR-513)\nRefreshing. Firefox. If your workstation uses Firefox and you load a drawing's enterprise graphics in Web Central or in the Smart Client, then republish\nthat drawing's enterprise graphics, the change may not appear when you reload the view with the enterprise graphics. For performance reasons, some\nversions of Firefox do not immediately refresh the enterprise graphics files from their local cache even when the file has a later time stamp, as checking\nthe time stamp involves an extra query to the server for each file. To view your changes, clear your cache or restart your browser. If you wish to see\nchanges immediately without clearing your cache, you can change your browser cache settings to control the problem.\n1. In Firefox's menu, select Tools >\u00a0Options.\n2. Select the Advanced tab, and then the Network tab.\n3. In the Offline Storage section, enter 0 for the MB of space used for the cache.(3024655)\nSmart Client Extension for Revit known limitations\nPublishing. If you publish a Revit model and then modify it, and wish to republish the 3D model in the current Revit session, you must first save the model and\nthen republish. (AD-14319)\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nUncatalog. With Revit 2022 running on Windows 11, you cannot select Asset Type on the Uncatalog form. (AD-10027)\nNames of Models and Levels. Currently, the Smart Client Extension for Revit does not support model names or level names containing the '-' character. (AD-\n9418)\nFile Names with Special Characters. When you publish a Revit file whose file name contains spaces and characters such as #+\u00b0$(), you may receive an error\nmessage when viewing the SVG file in Web Central. (WC-3132)\nOpening a Model. Error Message. Due to the way that Updater classes are implemented, Revit presents a message that you are missing a third-party updater.\nYou can ignore this message. (SMAR-974).\nNumber.\nIf you Number a room and then use the Smart Client to show the Room field \"Perimeter ft\u201d, the perimeter shows as 0. If you Data Edit or Data Edit\nMultiple, the number is corrected. (SMAR-285)\nIf the database does not contain enough information for the Number command to execute, it fails to number instead of providing feedback to the user\nabout what database information is needed to successfully run the command. (SMAR-526)\nRooms. Deleting. Revit does not notify Archibus when Revit deletes rooms. Currently, Archibus cannot uncatalog rooms on that event. Use the Synchronization\n/ Uncatalog Records without Assets command to clear the Drawing Name and Id fields on these rooms in one step.\nWeb Query. If the last primary key value for an asset is a single digit (e.g. if you query for room \"1\"), then the pop up dialog results are not restricted to that one\nrecord. This doesn't occur for two- and three-digit IDs (e.g. room \"10\" or \"100\"). (3035367, 3035366, 3034950, 3034414)\nPublish Enterprise Graphics. Colors. Since Revit floor plans do not have color, colors for Enterprise Graphics generated from Revit can cause confusion,\nespecially since the user does not have control over this. In a future release, Archibus will address this issue. (SMAR-988)\n\nEdit Data\u00a0\nRooms. Some objects in linked models are not correctly picking up room codes of the rooms they are inside of. (SMAR-785)\nGroup Areas. For new groups, the Group Code will show as \"1\" until the record is actually saved. Thereafter, the proper autonumbered ID will show.\n(3034828)\nSuite Areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0. If\nyou press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nLong Parameter Values. If you have a parameter value (e.g. Name) mapped to an Archibus field (e.g. Option 1), and that parameter has an existing\nvalue longer than the field width in Archibus, then you will not be able to create a record using Edit Data. You can shorten the parameter value using the\nRevit Parameters dialog. Alternately, if you use the Archibus Catalog command, the command will find all of these conditions and allow you to rectify them\nindividually or in groups. (3034793)\nMap Database Fields. This form is empty if there are no assets in the model of the specified asset type. (3034357)\nCopy / Paste. If you copy and paste furniture and equipment, you also copy and paste their Revit properties. Use the Archibus synchronization commands to\nfind and resolve any duplicates. (3030989)\nOutlook Plugin known limitations\nRegistry Entry to Keep Enabled. To ensure the Plugin cannot be disabled by users and will not be disabled automatically by Outlook, you must replace the\nfollowing DWORD registry value (which is added by the standard installer)\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=dword:1\nwith a string value.\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=\"1\"\nThis replacement can be implemented by customizing the Outlook Plugin MSI installer with a customization tool such as Master Packager. (AD-10391)\nSystem Administration known limitations\nSecurity. False Positive Vulnerability. If you do a Veracode scan on Web Central, you will receive a vulnerability warning concerning\nHttpInvokerServiceExporter, which is used by Spring. Note that Web Central does not use HttpInvokerServiceExporter, so you can ignore this warning. (AD-12773)\nSecurity. LDAP. The result of using a distinguished name with a comma results in this error in archibus.log: \"LDAP: error code 49 - Invalid Credentials\". The\nsolution is to change the bind user's \"CN=\" value to a name that does not contain a comma. (3037258)\nSecurity. SSO. In SSO mode, when the user name is incorrect, the user is redirected to the timeout page instead of the SSO error page. (WC-2027)\nIofT. Oracle. The Technologies / Innovative Solutions /Integrations - IoT / IoT Space Utilization view is not Oracle-compatible. (AD-8296)\nSolution Templates. Calendar Control. The Reservations Calendar example records multiple days for one-day events. (WC-3237)\nConnectListener. When ConnectListener runs, it does not move the previous afm_conn_log entries to afm_conn_logh. (AD-7003)\nSchema Change Wizard. The archibus.log fails to show correctly field and table name in the global dataset. This is only a logging issue. There is no functional\nerror. (3033565)\nGrid. API. Grid panels can display custom values calculated in Java Script code. An example can be seen in the following view. This example displays the\ncustom Location field that is composed from Building, Floor, Room, and Location database fields. The example also includes a menu that allows the user to\nproduce reports with the grid data. Due to Web Central technical implementation limitation, custom values formatted in Java Script code cannot be displayed in\nthese reports. (3041685)\nPath: Technologies / User Interface Add-Ins / Assemblies with Multiple Panels / Find-Manage with Categories\nFile: ab-products\\solutions\\assemblies\\work-wizard\\ab-ex-work-wizard.js\nFunction: updateLocations()\nGrid. API. When designing views with a grid panel, you cannot set specific grid column width in pixels. The grid automatically sets column widths according to\nthe available space and the data displayed in each column. (3045398)\nGrid. API. The Clear Filter icon is not visible if the last grid column is hidden. To avoid the issue, add an empty last column. The condition does not affect any of\nthe Archibus applications. (3040363)\nDatabase known limitations\nDatabase Update Wizard. runDuw.sql script. The Database Update Wizard generates an SQL script called runDuw.sql. When writing this file, it does not\nreplace macros with SQL. (AD-10595)\nMobile Framework known limitations\nFail to Log in Again. iOS. If you log in, close mobile client, and then attempt to log in again, you will find that you cannot log in. The failure stems from being\nalready logged into the OIDC connector and trying to reestablish a session. IOS has not been fully upgraded for service workers due to extra restrictions service\nworkers have in IOS Safari. Therefore IOS still requires the connection checks. A workaround is to wait until the OIDC session is invalid/logged out, as well as\nnot selecting \"remember me\" (for example in Okta) while on IOS. Not closing the app while there is a valid session will avoid this issue entirely. This is not an\nissue for Android. (AD-6517)\nSurveys. Measurement Questions. Android. With the survey (questionnaire) features in both Maintenance and Compliance Surveys mobile apps, users can\nenter non-numeric values for Measurement questions. These values do not correctly upload when the mobile apps are synced. A future version will add\nvalidation so that users can input only numbers as the answer of Measurement type questions. (AD-4600)\nMobile App known limitations\nCompliance Surveys. Questionnaires. If a questionnaire requires a service request and the service request is created and then deleted, the questionnaire will\nstill indicate the service request step is complete. (AD-9047)\nMaintenance. Resources. If you add resources, such as parts, tools, and costs, you will not see the new resource records in both Resource Details form. Thus,\nyou might think the resource records were not added. After syncing, you will see that the resource record were successfully added. (AD-5908)\nMaintenance.uniqueidentifier Error. Due to Archibus resetting an application parameter for use with OnSite, users of the Maintenance mobile app will\nencounter the \"uniqueidentifier property to be defined\" error after completing a checklist or refreshing the screen. To resolve this, run System / Archibus\nAdministrator - Application Configuration / Configure Application Parameters and reset the AbCommonResources.MobileSyncDataChangesOnlyTables\napplication parameter to: bl;eq;rm;rmpct;dv;dp;fl;em;pt_store_loc_pt. (AD-11666, AD-11679)\nMaintenance. Checklists. Android 11. If you try to create a request from a work request's checklist, you receive a blank screen. This occurs only on Android 11.\n(AD-5863)\nMaintenance. Stopping Work. Supervisors cannot stop a work request that has a pending checklist. (AD-4883)\nMaintenance. Reopening a Checklist when Verifying It. If a supervisor reopens a checklist during the verify process, the work request correctly moves back to\nthe Issued status. If this work request's checklist is still pending and the supervisor or craftsperson now selects multiple work requests to complete (including this\none), you will find that you can complete this work request despite the fact that it has an open checklist. The issue does not occur when working from the My\nWork form because the form does not support multi-select action. (AD-4882)\nMaintenance. Confirmation. SLAs can contain Confirmation steps on the \"Issued\" and \"Completed\" statuses. Users who are assigned to these steps can\nperform the confirmation (Approve/Reject/Cancel) in the Maintenance Console, but this feature is not supported in the mobile Maintenance app. Confirmation\nsteps work only on the \"Requested\" and \"Assigned to Work Order\" statuses on mobile. (AD-7267)\n\nMaintenance. Sync Issues.\nWhen a user performs a Sync action on the mobile Maintenance app, any craftspersons hours data (such as Actual Hours or Overtime Hours) can be\noverwritten if those hours were entered in Web Central. (3045897)\nWhen a requestor reports multiple maintenance requests of the same type from different locations and then syncs to upload all the requests at once, the\nmobile app does not consistently upload all the requests. To avoid this problem, sync after entering each request. (3048805).\nPart quantities are synced on the mobile Maintenance app only when you sync the background data. This affects mobile users who perform any of the\nfollowing actions on the mobile maintenance application:\no Estimate parts on a work request\no Add purchased parts to inventory\no Complete a work request that includes parts\nAfter you perform any of these actions and sync, the system will update the part quantities correctly in the database and they will appear correctly in Web\nCentral; however, the mobile application will not show these new quantities. Also, any changes made by other mobile users or Web Central users to the\npart quantities will not be synced. The workaround is to go the Sync settings on the mobile application and click the button that says \u201cReset Background\nData Sync Flag\u201d. When you return to the Maintenance application, the background data will automatically sync, and the part quantities will be updated on\nthe device. (3053237)\nMaintenance. Seeing Rejected Requests. Approvers can reject requests back to the requestor or step completer. However, mobile users cannot see or\nresubmit those rejected requests from the mobile application. This must be done from the Building Operations Console.(3048370)\nMaintenance. Photos. You can request maintenance from the Workplace Services Portal app and the Maintenance app, and you can update maintenance\nrequests from the Maintenance app. However, the two apps store maintenance photos in different tables (wr and activity_log), which can cause problems when\nediting or deleting a photo. When you request maintenance using the Workplace Services Portal app and add a photo, and then access the corresponding work\nrequest using the Maintenance app, the photo will be shown. However, if later the photo is deleted by the Maintenance team from the work request (wr) record,\nthe photo will not be deleted from the activity_log record, and vice versa. There are several alternative scenarios for adding, changing, or deleting photos which\nmay cause this kind of issue. This issue will be fixed in a future release. (3047423)\nWorkplace Portal. Chinese. If you enter a space after a Building Code value, you will encounter an error with Rooms / Locate Employee.

Does not correctly set the \u201cAttendees in Room\u201d field value when creating meetings; there is no way for\na user to manually edit this value. (AD-4856)\nReservations Calendar Console. Recurring Reservations for Monthly Meetings. The timeline does not always correctly display recurring patterns for\nmonthly meetings. For example, if you created a reservation for the first Monday of the month, the Reservations Calendar Console might show all Mondays in\nthe month. Although the timeline might not display these reservations correctly, the Console does correctly save these meeting dates and the summary text\nreflects the proper date. (APP-6651)(AD-1028)\nReservations Calendar Console. Room Configurations. For situations in which multiple reservations exist at the same time in the same room, but for different\nroom configurations, the calendar displays only one reservation. (APP-6561)\nReservations Calendar Console. Continuous Meetings. The system does not prompt you resolve continuous meetings that have conflicts; when it encounters\nthis situation, the system generates a workflow rule error. (APP-6535)\nReservations Calendar Console. Conference Calls.\nIf you create a conference call and you select several buildings in order to select rooms in several buildings; and if many of the rooms in one building are\nreservable, all of the rooms for this building are shown, and reservable rooms from other buildings are not displayed. This can make hard to select rooms\nfrom different buildings. The TimelineMaxRoomsPerBuilding application parameter does not control this.(APP-6214)\nYou cannot edit the date and time of a conference call reservation. (APP-6613)\nReservations Calendar Console. Changing Room Selection. Time not Recorded. If you select a room, select a time, add some resources, and select\nanother room; you will find that the designated time does not persist to the second room. (APP-6800)\nReservations Calendar Console. Application Parameters. The TimelineStartTime and TimelineEndTime parameters work only with one-hour\nincrements. If you enter times such as 9:30 and 17:30 in the parameters, the Calendar Console does not consider them. (APP-6698)\nCreate Resource Reservation. Reservation Timeline. Microsoft Surface. You cannot drag with touch input a reservation on the timeline. Timeline drag-and-\ndrop supports only mouse events. (APP-3312)\nOutlook Plugin. My Reservations. When the Outlook Plugin displays the My Reservations, the popup is opened without the option to edit any of the\nreservations showed, so users cannot add resources. The Add Reservation button is also disabled. (AD-4846)\nGoogle Calendar Integration. When you have configured the application for \"no integration\" with Exchange, the .ics files that are generated to be imported into\nOutlook, Google Calendar, or any other calendar app, sometimes do not correctly update the Google Calendar application. Specifically, there can be a problem\nwith the file content related to the meeting identifiers created by the application. These meeting identifiers are not always unique. If you create a new calendar,\ninstead of importing an existing one, the creation of meetings seems to work correctly for single and recurring reservations, but updates and cancellations don\u2019t\nalways work as expected.\nSpace known limitations\nView and Print Floor Plan. If Room Category and Room Type have the same value, only one value is displayed in the drawing. (AD-10178)\nSpace Console. Advanced Filter. If you select two distinct floor plans (for example, AB01 and HQ18) and then filter by floors using the Advanced filter, the\nSpace Console will only show one floor. (AD-14674)\nSpace Console. Export What You See. If you select multiple floor plans to display, only the first displayed floor plan is exported. All visible floor plans should\nexport. (AD-12658)\nSpace Console. Bulk Editing Rooms. If you select from the floor plan more than 10 rooms and attempt to bulk-edit them, the form may not display all the fields\nand buttons making it difficult or impossible to edit the selected rooms. When editing rooms in bulk, edit fewer than 10 rooms at one time. (AD-2711)\nSpace Console. Generate Ad Hoc PDF. Large Drawings. For large drawings, such as one with an SVG size of 5590K, the report may not generate. In these\ncases, increase the memory, such as increasing the Tomcat memory to 2048 M. (AD-2048)\nSpace Console. Employees Tab. Selecting Employees. If you have a list of employees that runs over multiple pages, when you select employees and then\nmove to \"Next\" or \"Previous\" page, the selection will be cleared. As a workaround, you can first use the \"Place Employee in Waiting Room\" or \"Unassign\" action\nfor the selected employees on the current page, and then move to a different page to select additional employees. (AD-2741)\nSpace Console. Team Space. Organization Name Field. When assigning associations to teams, you will see that the Associations tab includes the\nOrganization Name field. This is validated by the Organizational Units (org) table. To create the values for the Organizational Units table so that they are\n\navailable when completing the Organization Name field, you must use the Smart Client. Create a new view that holds the org table and use this view to define\nyour organizational units. (3052882)\nSpace Console. Plan Types. Using Plan Types on the Space Console affords the user the ability to personalize highlights, text labels, and printed legends to\nthe deployment's needs, in addition to the pre-existing highlights and label options that exist on the Space Console's drop-down menus. The Add-In Manager\ndefines Plan Type highlights and labels by creating or modifying view files and datasources that are logged in the active_plantypes table. However, to make\nchanges or add legend datasources, in addition to defining those datasources in the view file that active_plantypes references, the Add-In manager must:\n1. Make an associated change in the same view file for a highlight datasource, and name it as the legend is named. For example, if the Add-In Manager\nmakes a legend datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend\", they must also make an associated highlight datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-\nhl-rm-by-dp-name_rmHighlight\".\n2. In the PDF export AXVW file ab-sp-console-export-drawing-pdf.axvw, the Add-in Manager must also create a legend-type panel and refer to the\nnew legend datasource. Following the same example, the panel's id must be named panel_ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend, and the\ndatasource must equal ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend. The fields that the datasource defines and that should be visible in the legend must\nbe defined in that panel. (3050005)\nSpace Requests. Moves. If you change the From Location in a space request, use Space / Moves / Move Coordinator / Complete Group Moves to close the\nmove, and check the rmpct record, you will see that the value for primary_em is still 0. It should change to 1 since user has changed the From Location from\nsatellite location to primary location. The conditions for this situation are: workspace transactions are enabled, the SLA for Group Move calls for the service\nprovider as Move Management and no approvers, and the application parameters are: InferRoomDepartments=0 and\nAssignUnallocatedSpace=ProrateFloor. (3043629)\nMoves. Action Questionnaires. If you add new Action Types (using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Types task), you cannot add\nquestionnaires to these new action types using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Questionnaires task. (3028382)\nMaintenance known limitations\nEquipment Maintenance History. This view (ab-pm-rpt-eq-maint-hist.axvw) does not properly filter results when used with Oracle. (AD-15482)\nTime Zones. You will encounter the wrong time zone in work orders (11:57 AM instead of 1:57 PM) if you select the \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value as the time zone using\nthe Define Geographical Locations view. Instead, select a city-specific time zone such as \"Europe/Paris timezone(UTC+1)\". The \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value will be\nremoved in the future as it is not necessary. (AD-8802)\nMaintenance Console. Sorting. The first time that you sort the Maintenance Console's grid by a field it correctly sorts; if you sort by the same fields multiple\ntimes, the sort does not work and the arrow in the header row does not update correctly. (AD-7932)\nCraftspersons. Notifications. For SLAs that are configured so craftspersons are to be notified when work is issued (notify craftsperson check-box), the\ncraftsperson is not receiving notification when the work is issued. (AD-4960)\nCraftsperson Sample Data. In the sample HQ project, there are many records in Craftspersons (cf) table that do not have email account; also many have\nduplicated email accounts like no-response@archibustgd.com. The key convention for the workflow is: cf.email=em.email=afm_users.email. These\nvalues must be unique. To fix this issue, just remove those records from the cf table for which emails are either empty or have duplicated value. Below are some\nsituations where duplicated values can cause problems\nLaunch SLA console, dispatch to supervisor, click Select Value, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_supervisor=1\nContinue to add a estimation step, select employee to do estimation, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_estimator=1\nLaunch the Maintenance Console, click any work request, click the Forward button, select supervisor, you will see all employees instead of all meeting the\nrestriction: cf.is_supervisor=1.(AD-6744)\nAssets and BIM\u00a0Viewer known limitations\nBIM\u00a0Viewer\nLocalized. In localized versions of Archibus, you will find that the tooltips on the Autodesk Forge toolbar are not localized. (AD-12210)\nBlank Worksheets. For some Revit 2022 models, the new feature \u201cSheets & Views\u201d may display the worksheets as blank. This is an issue with the\nAutodesk Platform Services API that we could not fix on our side and we are waiting for Autodesk to fix. (AD-10801)\nModels Not Displaying. Some models may not display in V.2023.04, but we have fixed the issue in V.2024.01. If you wish to receive a patch for\nV.2023.04, contact Customer Support. (AD-16273)\nAsset Lifecycle Console. Classification Filter. When you filter for a classification, in the Select Value list associated with the Classification filter, the\nClassifications tree expands automatically up to the second level. The returned classification results may be at lower levels, so you may need to manually\nexpand the tree to see everything. Ideally, the Asset Lifecycle Console would automatically expand to the appropriate level; however, it expands only to the\nsecond level due to potential performance issues on larger inventories of assets. ( AD-10324 )\nAsset Disposal Console. Inventory of Asset Systems report. Oracle only. The Inventory of Asset Systems report (available from the Reports button on the\nAsset Relationship Analysis tab) presents a workflow rule error if you are running on Oracle. (AD-14128)\nAsset Disposal Console. Changing Building Status from Asset Disposal Console Causes Inconsistencies in Real Estate. The Asset Disposal Console\nupdates the asset records for Buildings and Properties as well as inserts OT records to match when the asset is disposed of. REPM reports on Owned, Pipeline,\nand Disposed OT statuses for buildings, but ignores buildings with other ownership transaction statuses, or gives unexpected results in reports. The Real Estate\ndomain's Add/Edit Wizard does not have a way to modify the status of the bl record. Setting the transaction Status to Owner does not change the status of the\nbuilding to Owned. Coordinate OT records with asset status in both Real Estate and Disposal Console. (APP-852)\nDefine Classifications. Deleting Top Levels. In the Define Classification view (ab-ca-def-class.axvw, which is available from the Business Process\nOwner process of Asset Management, Condition Assessment, and Environmental Sustainability Assessment), you cannot delete a top level. Instead, you must\ndelete the top level by using Smart Client and deleting the record from the csi table. If you are not going to use a top-level classification hierarchy, it is advisable\nto delete all the child records (under the top level) before deleting the top level. (AD-6682)\nClassifications. Localization. Numeric ID (Automatic Lookup). The Classifications (csi) and Classification Standards (csi_std) tables are not translatable.\nTherefore, in order to use the Automatic Lookups (Numeric IDs) feature for asset classifications, enable Automatic Lookups for them without\nafm_scmpref.preferences. Otherwise, Archibus will look for the translatable fields in the two tables, resulting in application errors. Also, the Asset\nClassification Description field (csi.description) and the field Classification Standard Description (csi_std.description) are not translatable. If enabling\nthe Automatic Lookup for these fields, do not use the attribute displayType=\"translate\" because the fields are not translatable.(APP-4286) (AD-6683).\nEnterprise Assets known limitations\nProject Proposal Console. Baseline cost of a Billion Monetary Units or Greater. If you enter a baseline cost for an individual required asset that is a billion\nmonetary units or greater, you get an error that the value entered exceeds the maximum storage unit for the field. This is because the value for the baseline cost\nin the sb_items table is defined as numeric (9,1). However, the value you entered displays correctly in the grid and in the statistical summary because the value\nin the eq_req_items table is defined as numeric (16,2). This error occurs only in the rare case that the cost of an individual asset is a billion monetary units or\ngreater. (3052851)\nProject Proposal Console. Selected Period Fields not Displaying. The default selection is to display Baseline and Period 1. If you add other period fields but\nthen want to return to the default setting and find that the Console is not displaying your selection, clear your browser cache. (APP-1601)\nManage Reference Documents. This task enables you to associate a document with a Building Use, Property Type, and Furniture Standard. However, there is\ncurrently no way to view documents added for these items. It also enables you to associate a document with projects of different types. Currently, you are able to\nview documents for only projects that have the Scenario type. You are, however, able to view documents added for work request Problem Types, PM\nprocedures, and action items that are associated with a Proposed project.

(3053673)\nSustainability &\u00a0Risk known limitations\nCompliance known limitations\nExtended Questionnaires. Service Requests from Mobile. Although the ability to create service requests from questionnaires was added to the Compliance\nSurveys mobile app, it has not yet been implemented in the Web Central Compliance application. Therefore, if a mobile questionnaire respondent provides\ndetails for a follow-up Service Request actions for any question in a questionnaire, then the respondent should take care to fully submit the questionnaire via the\nmobile app; they should not edit or submit via the Web Central questionnaire edit form because the Web Central edit form might not preserve the request details\nor set the status of the request as expected via the mobile app. (APP-4250)\nExtended Questionnaires. Assigned to Events. View my Events Calendar. The \"View My Events Calendar\" task for Compliance Program Coordinators does\nnot provide a link from events details to answer or review any questionnaires that might be attached to assigned events. The workaround is for Program\nCoordinators to use one of the other \"My... Events\" tasks to access assigned questionnaires. (APP-1667)\nExtended Questionnaires. Question Tree. Nodes without Child Records. In the Define Compliance Questionnaire view, when you examine a question that\nhas multiple choice answers, you will see that the Question Tree does not indicate that a node has no child content. When a node has no children, it still displays\nthe triangle-shaped icon for expanding and collapsing, giving the impression that there are child records. After you click the node, the triangle disappears until\nrefresh. (WC-2386)\nContracts and Compliance Programs with Cost Records. Deleting. You must first delete all assigned cost records associated with a contract or program or\nrequirement or term before you can delete the coordinating record. (APP-2276)\nHazard Abatement known limitations\nHomogeneous Areas not Highlighted. The application does not currently highlight all rooms identified as containing portions of homogeneous areas when\nthere are no assessments directly associated with those rooms. (APP-5240)\nWaste known limitations\nHazardous Waste Accumulation Report. The application stores and displays the hazardous waste accumulation volume limit application parameter value in\nunits of US Gallons. Users must take care to convert any other volume limit parameter into gallons if they adjust the application parameter controlling this. In any\ncase, the application does automatically and correctly convert the accumulated waste quantity to compare against this standard, no matter what units the waste\nhad been recorded in. (APP-5470)\nWaste Container Labels. The application generates formatted label documents for selected waste records. The web pop-up dialogue that shows the results of\nthe document creation has a bug limiting the display of outputted documents to 4 records. However, the application does still produce label documents for all the\nselected records as distinct files, named according to the waste record id number and saved to the .../WebCentral/schema/per-site/pdf-forms/[username] folder.\n(APP-5241)\nEnergy\u00a0known limitations\nProrating bills. Duplicate Bills. If you happen to enter duplicate bills for the same building and vendor with overlapping dates of service, and then attempt to\nauto-generate prorated bills, the application may encounter a duplicate primary key error when trying to generate one or more of the bill records. This is because\nthe resulting time periods will be the same, and the proration action will fail. (APP-5242, AD-924)\nConfigure Bill Processing. Excluded Bill Types. Archived Bills. The Configure Bill Processing view allows users to choose to exclude certain bill types from\nthe application's rules requiring bills to be archived in contiguous, ordered, monthly series. However, if an unusual situation occurs wherein a vendor account's\nutility bill type should change after some bills have already been archived, then the application will ignore a request to exclude the new bill type for new incoming\nbills for that vendor account. A work-around is to exclude both the old and new utility bill types from the monthly bill test. (APP-1855)\nProcess BAS Data View. The Web Central core does not yet support grid indexes on dates fields or on calculated fields. For example, if you create an index on\na date field having the value 2014-01-01, the value first shows as \u20182 \u2013 All.\u2019 If you click the \u20182\u2019 option, the value changes to \u201820\u2019; click the \u201820\u2019 and it's transformed to\n\u2018201\u2019; click the \u2018201\u2019 and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2019; click again, and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2026.\u2019 This issue appears in the right \u201cClean num\u201d panel in Energy\nManagement's Process BAS Data view. (WC-3108)\nView Prorated and Aggregated Bills. In rare cases, when the sum of aggregated bills exceeds a value 1000000 in the chosen display units, the application will\npresent an alert message stating that the value of the calculated field exceeds the field's maximum. In this view, the user may safely dismiss this message and\nproceed to view the bill record. (APP-5270)\nCapital Projects known limitations\nProjects known limitations\nProjects. Importing from Microsoft Project. From the Projects / Execute / Procure task / Import tab you can import an *.xml file from Microsoft Project.\nDepending on your version of Microsoft Project, you may need to choose to \u201cOpen as a new project.\" Otherwise, you may encounter errors with the\npredecessors values if you decide to append the data or merge the data. (3011985)\nProject Template. VPA. With VPA active, if you use the Projects / Set Up / Define Template Projects task to create a new project and enter a Project Type and\nTitle, you will find that the process fails and a template project is not created. As a work-around, add NULL to the Site VPA list; this allows a Project record to be\ngenerated. (AD-8105)\nConnectors known limitations\nReserved Words. Archibus does not support field names with reserved words. For example, adding the field \"alter\" to the table bl, causes the Archibus\napplication server to fail to start when attempting to restart it. Therefore, the INBOUND use case of importing data into an Archibus table that has a field named\nwith a reserved word is not supported. The OUTBOUND use case of exporting data to a remote system like BUILDER SMS that has a database field that uses a\nreserved word (ex. order) is supported. (APP-3975)(APP-4769)\nEDI Example. The example file provided for the EDI connector in the HQ project demonstrates Web Central\u2019s ability to process EDI data formats, but only\naddresses the bill table. Since the example lacks a bill_lines connector definition and a bill connector association, it is not possible to fully load a complete utility\nbill using the EDI connector example. In the future, we plan to make a new example that is more realistic available for download. (3047882)\nBackslash Character. In some environments entering \\\\ in connector field parameters or connector parameters may result in the \\\\ being saved as \\. As a\nworkaround, for a field enter \\\\\\\\ for \\\\ every time you save the field. For connector parameters, avoid use of \\\\; or, use \\\\\\\\ and fix configuration in post\nprocess. (3045250, 3047842)\nSaving. Saving a connector does not display the standard \u201cRecord Successfully Saved\u201d banner. (3045250)\nExtensions for BUILDERTM SMS known limitation\nAsset Attributes. Numeric Values. Separators. When entering numerical values for an asset attribute (ex. Quantity) do not enter a numeric separator such as\na comma. If a comma is entered in the asset attribute value as a numeric separator, the connector framework will not know how to process the comma and the\n\ndata transfer to BUILDER SMS will fail. (APP-5603)\nOutbound Connector. Condition Assessment Items. The master outbound connector SMS_ARCHIBUS_BUILDER_Inspect exports all condition assessment\nitems for a given section with date assessed in the past 90 days or within the number of days from current date set in the application parameter\nAbCapitalPlanningCA-BUILDER_InspectionDate_NewerThan and not only the most recent condition assessment record for the that section and for that\ntime interval.

The topics in the following section of System Management Help were updated to reflect the software changes made in V2022.01.\nhttps://help.archibus.com/system/sysman.htm#outlook_plugin/exchange_res_overview.htm\nEsri. The Esri topics in System Management Help were completely revamped. https://help.archibus.com/system/sysman.htm#gis/esri/oveview.htm (AD-9973)\nChanges in Web Central\nDocument Management. File Types. For security reasons, we have changed documentManagement file types in afm-config.xml. We now support uploading\nthe following file types: docx, xlsx, mpp, pdf, jpeg. jpg. We have removed support for: doc, xls, dwg, dwf, txt, gif, bmp, png, mp4, zip, xml, htm, html. If you have\nuploaded documents whose types are now not supported, those documents remain as is; however, you cannot add additional files of those types. (AD-9523, AD-\n9967, AD-10156, AD-10301, AD-1044)\nBIRT. Due to BIRT 4.8.0 having a high-level security issue that requires Java 11 to resolve, we have removed all BIRT-related files. (AD-9575)\nAutomatic Lookup. We have resolved an inconsistent behavior when automatic lookup is enabled. (AD-8345, AD-8348)\n\nNotification Log View. The ab-notifications-log.axvw view now can show OnSite push notifications by selecting the AbOnSiteMobile application. The view has\nbeen renamed from \"Email Notification Log\" to \"Notification Log.\" (AD-8940, AD-8925, AD-8197)\nMail. Added mail.send.rate and mail.send.rateUnit to mail.properties to limit the rate at which Web Central sends emails without attachments to an SMTP\nservice. Also added mail.host.sslProtocols parameter to mail.properties. (AD-9582, AD-10170, AD-3887)\nTimeout. Fixed a problem with TimeOutView not redirecting properly. (AD-9383)\nDocument Fields. If you check in documents that have uses spaces in their file names, Archibus no longer replaces each space with the \"+\" character. (AD-9421)\nTranslation. Improvements to a few translations, including the Log in button in Japanese. (AD-10421)\nData Event Listeners. Addressed issue in data event listeners listening to changes to leases. (AD-10291)\nData Event Log. Addressed error when clicking on SqlExecuted events in Data Events Log. (AD-9269)\nConsole Views. Improved consistency of Check All function when selecting multiple items. (AD-7949)\nUser Interface. Aesthetic improvements to spacing and titling of message dialogs. (AD-3845)\nBar Charts. Addressed \u201c_.map Object is not a function\u201d error when clicking on bar charts. (AD-9763)\nDrawing Control. Addressed multiple executions when clearing highlights. (AD-9404)\nDrawing Control. Resolved problem with floor plans zooming in unexpectedly on some devices. (AD-7512)\nTabs. Addressed error in tab logic depending on a previous tab, where there isn\u2019t one. (AD-9509)\nLocalization. Enable all localization languages by default. (AD-9408)\nSecurity. Addressed a variety of injection, library, and cross-site scripting issues. (AD-9836, AD-9674, AD-7844, AD-9306, AD-9319, AD-9321, AD-9335, AD-9337, AD-9399, AD-\n8757)\nNumber of Buildings. Added a common property that counts the number of buildings. (AD-9860)\nFilters. Address issue using an apostrophe character in a filter console. (AD-9878)\nExtended Questionnaires. Error Message for Mixed Section. The following issue is resolved: Adding one single choice question to the Mixed Section using\nthe \"...\" button of this section and then adding a Date question by using the \"Add Question\" button (at the top of the tab) presents an error message. As a\nworkaround, add the Date question using the \u2018\u2026' button of the mixed section, rather than the Add Question button. (AD-4868)\nNavigator. System Administration / CAD and BIM Manager process. This process has two new tasks: Connect BIM Viewer to Autodesk, Catalog BIM\u00a0Model.\n(AD-10334, AD-10338)\nChanges in Smart Client, Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD and Revit\nSetup Console. De-supported. It is not longer part of the Smart Client installer (AD-10321)\nSmart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. Improved UI visibility on high resolution monitors.\nSmart Client Extension for Revit\nClear Archibus Data from Model is a new command under the Synchronization drop-down. Detaches the Revit model from Archibus completely and\nremoves all Archibus data from the model. (AD-8473)\nMap Database form. Using the Refresh button no longer closes the form, improving the usability when mapping parameters to fields. (AD-8455)\nCataloging Assets. Fixed issue that was preventing cataloging assets other than equipment (AD-9482)\nSign in to Project . An \"object reference\" error was corrected. (AD-9419)\nPublish to Forge (Publish 3D). Publish to Forge from Revit is now fully supported and is no longer for trial purposes only.\nChanges in Mobile Client and Mobile Apps\nMobile Client 3.0. Google Play. Mobile Client 3.0 is no longer available on Google Play. Only Mobile Client 4.0. is available.\nMobile Client. Fixed issues with launching the camera on Android versions 10, 11, and 12 (AD-10309)\nCompliance Surveys. Syncing. If the auditor has a long list of survey tasks and syncs a complete survey, they no longer see that some incomplete survey\ntasks disappear. (AD-7194)\nCompliance Surveys. Truncated Text. The text for a Yes/No or Multiple Choice question is now correctly displayed and is not truncated on your mobile device;\nyou no longer need to edit the question and change the Display Format from Short to Long. (AD-6407)\nAssessments. Improved the visibility of completed items. (AD-9221)\nAsset Surveys. Added the ability to scan room barcode. (AD-7363)\nMaintenance. Work Log time error is corrected. (AD-8976)\nChanges in OnSite Mobile App\nTagging all users in comments. You can now tag any user, not just those that are in the Employees (em) or Craftspersons (cf) tables, when making a\ncomment. This is handy for when other users (such as guests, or visitors) make requests; these users now show in the selection list for the tagging action. (ON-\n1038)\nCreate Request. Add Photos. When a technician creates a request using OnSite, they can now add photos to the request. (ON-1033)\nClosing a Work Requests Generated from a Checklist. The following issue is resolved and applying the database script is no longer necessary: if you have to\ngenerate a new work request as an action for completing a checklist, you will encounter problems when trying to close this work request. The\n/webapp/projects/users/public/dt/v2022.02.003 folder contains a correction for OnSite pertaining to closing work requests that were generated as a follow-up\naction to a checklist question. Database administrators can apply the scripts as desired. (AD-9381, ON-971)\nWork Request List. Updating. Previous work request data was persisting in the cache and displaying in the work request list. This is no longer an issue and\nyou do not need to pull to refresh on My Work in order to get the updated requests. (ON-733)\nRequestor section. Message icon. Android. In some versions of Android phones, clicking on the message icon did not work and the message form did not\nopen. This was due to a bug in React Native, but is now resolved. (ON-525)\nVPA. We have improved the messaging regarding the following situation: if multiple craftspersons assigned to the same work request do not have the same VPA\nand if one craftsperson creates a work request from a checklist, the other craftsperson will not be able to access the work request. (ON-973)\nChanges in Database\nSee the following topics in System Management Help:\u00a0Database Schema Revision History and Upgrade Notes.\nChanges in System\nBIRT. For security reasons, we removed BIRT report views from the product, but we omitted this change from upgrade scripts. Any views using BIRT or in the\nBIRT Pick-and-Place Reports process will not function, and we recommend removing them from the Navigator. (AD-9812)\nICS and Time Zones. Resolved. The following issue is resolved: ical4j jar is used to resolve timezone information. For example, it will try to open\nhttp://tzurl.org/zoneinfo/America/New_York which is a URL referenced by the America/New_York.ics file in the jar. The response to an HTTP request to this URL\nwill be an HTTP 302 redirect to https://static.tzurl.org/zoneinfo/America/New_York.ics which is the actual file containing timezone information.\nWe\u2019ve observed some implementations of java.net.URLConnection to not redirect, causing this redirect message to be processed as timezone data. This\nmanifests as exceptions when trying to use or resolve a timezone.\n\nThe workaround is to disable the feature for updating timezone data and use the information in the jar. To do this, add a text file named ical4j.properties to the\nroot of the java classpath with the following content:\nnet.fortuna.ical4j.timezone.update.enabled=false (AD-9432)\nAssign Processes to Roles or Users task. SaaS. This task has been updated with the following three changes to restrict access for client and partner\nadministrators in a SaaS environment:\nUsers assigned to role 4 - CLIENT ADMINISTRATOR (ACP) are now limited from seeing Roles and Users that have the following Roles:\n4 - SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR\nSYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR\nSYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR (ACP)\nARCHIBUS ADMINISTRATOR\n4 - PARTNER ADMINISTRATOR (ACP)\n4 - CLIENT ADMINISTRATOR (ACP)\nUsers assigned to role 4 - PARTNER ADMINISTRATOR (ACP) are now limited from seeing Roles and Users that have the following Roles:\n4 - SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR\nSYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR\nSYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR (ACP)\nARCHIBUS ADMINISTRATOR\n4 - PARTNER ADMINISTRATOR (ACP)\nUsers assigned to either of these two roles cannot assign Roles or Users to System Administration processes. They can still see existing assigned\nprocesses and also unassign processes from Roles or Users that they have access to.\n4 - CLIENT ADMINISTRATOR (ACP)\n4 - PARTNER ADMINISTRATOR (ACP) (AD-7128)\nChanges in Workplace\nGeneral\nDesktop. Open in App Button. On certain laptops with trackpads and without a mouse plugged in, Workplace formerly displayed the Open in App button, which\nshould have been displayed only in the Workplace mobile app. (AD-9349)\nService Catalog. Locations. When you select a location for the service request using the map and then switch to the Locations by Room Type tab, you will find\nthat the Room Types are now listed. (AD-9009).\nQR Codes. Signing In. When you access Workplace by scanning a QR code on a meeting room, workspace, or equipment, you might not be logged into\nWorkplace or have the Workplace mobile app on your phone. Previously, this would result in the request being created for user GUEST, and the item did not\nappear on your User Dashboard. To avoid this situation, Workplace now prompts you to sign in when scanning a QR code. (AD-9684)\nMaintenance Requests. Screens Displaying Request Number. For maintenance requests, the screens in Workplace that indicate a request number (such as\nUser Dashboard / My Requests or Request Details) now show the Work Request Code (wr_id) instead of the service request number. (AD-9376)\nMeeting Room Reservations\nAccessibility Mode. Fixed several UI issues for meeting room reservations on both Desktop and mobile. (AD-9555)\nDesk Bookings\nGuest users. Users signed in as GUEST\u00a0are now required to indicate an employee or visitor when they create a workspace booking. Guest users can no longer\nchoose \"For Myself\"; instead, Workplace moves them to the \u201cWorkspace Booking: Occupants List Selection\u201d page where they select a visitor or guest. With this\nchange, the occupant of the booking is now captured. (AD-9018)\nBooking for Others. User Interface. We have improved the UI so that a Workplace user can more easily create a workspace booking for themselves or others\nand reserve space that works for any size party. (AD-10087)\nQR Codes. Resolved. Attempting to book a room that was previously booked (but is now available) using the QR code results in the room not being available.\nOccupiers can use the QR code to check into their booking. Also, QR code users have trouble checking into a room. For example, if the room capacity is two or\nmore and if there is only one booking on the room, the Check-In button is not visible to QR code users. (AD-8284)\nSearch for Room Type and Employee. Resolved. If you search for a room based on room type and then search for a person's location, the filter should be\nreset to reflect both the room type and the employee; instead, the last selected filter (in this case, employee) clears the previous filter (in this case, Room Type).\n(AD-9465)\nConfirmation Check-in Message. Resolved. If a booking requires that you check in, when you book the room you receive a message reminding you to check\nin. On an iPhone running the Workplace mobile app or browser, the check-in confirmation message is truncated. (AD-9568)\nMultiple Bookings for the Same Room. Resolved. If you have the AllowMultipleBookings parameter set to No, you make a booking, and then select\nWorkspaces again; the recommendation shows the same room you just booked, the current date, and the option to book the room. You can go ahead and\nsuccessfully book the room a second time despite the setting of the AllowMultipleBookings parameter. (AD-9283)\nCancel. Workspace Booking Summary Page. Resolved. Select Cancel while on the Workspace Booking Summary page, and you move to the People &\nPlaces view, instead of the Dashboard landing page. (AD-9017)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nHiding the Create A Service Request Button. Resolved. Setting the SelfServiceCreateRequest and KioskCreateRequest application parameters to\n0 and scanning a QR code for a Room or Equipment should hide the \u201cCreate A Service Request\u201d button; however, the button does show. (AD-8746).\nWeb Browser. UI. Meeting Room Reservations. Resolved. If you reserve a meeting room and proceed to the \u201cMeeting Booking: Name and Attendees\u201d page,\nyou will find that the top of the Select Employee page or Select Department pages are cut off. (AD-8598)\nCancel Button. Resolved. On vertical tablets and phones, some form fields are not as high as other fields, creating an unbalanced look and resulting in the\nCancel icon not correctly fitting. (AD-8054)\nCalendar Icon. Resolved. The calendar icon is not clickable/tappable; only the date box is clickable/tappable, which opens both the calendar dropdown and the\nkeyboard at the same time. The keyboard blocks the calendar, making the view hard to work with. (AD-9478, AD-9479)\nCreate a Request form. No longer has extra white space. (AD-8864)\nConfirmation booking pop-up. Text no longer displays outside of the pop-up. (AD-9553)\nTruncated text. When Workplace was running on Pixel 4 (chrome and app) and iPhone 12 (safari and app), several screens were truncating text. This has been\nresolved. (AD-8337)\nChanges in Space\n\nSpace Console. Deselecting a room. Previously, in the following sequence, the selected room would remain selected despite using the Clear button to\ndeselect it. This is no longer an issue.\n1)In the floor plan, click on a room to select it.\n2)Highlight by a property such as Division.\n3)Invoke the Highlight form again and choose Clear Highlight to remove the highlight.\n4)On the floor plan, click Clear to deselect the room. Notice that it remains selected.\nTo resolve this issue, invoke the highlight again and clear it; the room will become unselected. (AD-9368)\nSpace Console. Performance. We made some performance enhancements to the Employee panel. (AD-9417)\nSpace Console. Workplace Utilization report. The Space Console now launches Workplace Utilization report. (AD-10102)\nDefine Buildings and Floors View (Foundations). Deleting buildings from the ab-ess-def-bl-fl.axvw view no longer takes an unreasonable amount of time. (AD-\n8091)\nSpace Console. PDF. The Generate Ad Hoc PDF Report has been renamed to Export to PDF.\nChanges in Real Property\nGlobal Portfolio Dashboard. Oracle. Chinese. When running this view with a Chinese local and Oracle database, the KPI session is no longer missing from\nthe upper left corner. (AD-9403)\nChargeback Cost Wizard. The Chargeback Cost Wizard's log file was showing a workflow rule error. This error is no longer generated. (AD-9530)\nRent Roll Report. Filter. We have made the filter collapsible so that users can see more data in the report's grid. \u00a0(AD-8830)\nChanges in Capital Projects\nApprove Bids. Under certain circumstances, you were unable to approve a bid using the Capital Projects / Projects / Procure /Approve Bids task; clicking the\nApprove button on this view had no action. This has been corrected. (AD-9138)\nChanges in Sustainability &\u00a0Risk\nCompliance. Manage All Compliance Events. Create Request from Questionnaire. Previously, if you selected an event that had a corresponding\nquestionnaire, you could not create a request from the questionnaire's Create Request button. This has been resolved. (AD-10142)\nChanges in Maintenance\nMaintenance Console. Group By. Collapsing. In order to improve performance, the Maintenance Console now collapses the groups when grouping is by\nCraftsperson or Work Order. This occurs regardless of the value of the AbBldgOpsOnDemandWork-BldgOpsConsoleExpandOnOpen application parameter.\nOther groupings follow the parameter setting. (AD-10380)\nMaintenance Console. Email Notifications. Attached Documents. The following issue has been resolved: If in the Manage Service Desk Steps task, you\nselect the Work Request Issued notification step and attach documents, you will find that for work requests using this SLA step, attachments are not included in\nthe email notification. (AD-7758)\nLabor Scheduler.Overlapping Scheduled Work. Previously, overlapping scheduled work was not shown when the view was set to show individual\ncraftspersons. This has been corrected. (AD-8032)\nLabor Scheduler. VPA. The Labor Scheduler view no longer presents an error message when VPA is active. (AD-9998)\nLabor Scheduler. Missing Work Requests. Previously, some work requests were not shown when multiple were assigned to single craftsperson in single day.\nThis has been resolved. (AD-8076)\nWork Requests. Tagging all Users in Comments. You can now tag any user, not just those that are in the Employees (em) or Craftspersons (cf) tables, when\nmaking a comment. This is handy for when other users (such as guests, or visitors) make requests; these users now show in the selection list for the tagging\naction. (AD-9515)\nDefine PM\u00a0Procedures, Steps, and Resources. UI\u00a0Change for Checklists. The tree now shows the Checklist Name instead of the Checklist ID. This change\nwill help users more easily locate checklists because they can see the descriptive checklist name. (AD-9353)\nMaintenance Survey Report. Multiple Response Questions. For multiple response questions, the report was showing the answers as code values rather than\nthe text that mapped to the codes, resulting in the fact that the report was not useful unless the reader had memorized the corresponding text value for each\ncode. This has been corrected. (AD-8792)\nChanges in Assets\nEquipment Systems Console: If auto-lookup is enabled, selecting the View Full Equipment Profile icon in the Equipment detail panel produces no longer an\nerror. (AD-8345)\nAsset Lifecycle Console. Classification Code Filter. Fixed searching by classification name. (AD-9816)\nAll Asset Consoles. Smart Search Filter. Fixed Asset Status filter to work for all asset types, not just buildings. (AD-9667)\nChanges in Workplace Services\nService Desk\nService Console. Firefox. The following components of the Service Console did not work on the Firefox browser: Search button, column sorting, Smart Search\nfilter, folding the request tree for each status. This has been resolved. (AD-9570)\nReservations\nReservations Calendar Console. Catering and Other Resources. Previously, when you edited a reservation with catering, if you changed the selected room\nto another room in the same building, an error message would state that the catering is not available under the new conditions; however, the catering was, in\nfact, still available. The catering was canceled, but you could manually add it again. Similarly, if you added limited or unique resources to the reservation and\nthen changed the room, those resources were also canceled; however, the system created them again under a new resource reservation id. This is no longer an\nissue. (AD-9651)\nReservations Calendar Console. Multiple Room Arrangements. Previously, if you had defined multiple arrangements with different time frames for a\nparticular room, the room arrangements were available for you to choose from the drop-down list when creating a reservation. However, you would find that\nwhen reserving a room with a particular arrangement, the times might not reflect the times assigned to the arrangement. This also occurred when making a\nreservation from Workplace. This is no longer an issue. (AD-9233)\nReservations Calendar Console. Yearly Recurrence Pattern. A problem with yearly recurrence selection yielding an error has been corrected. (AD-10502)\nReservations Calendar Console. Changing Rooms. Room calendar monitoring sometimes canceled a reservation when changing rooms. This has been\ncorrected. (AD-9653)\nOutlook Plugin. We updated the Smart Client DLLs in the Outlook Plugin. (AD-9592)\nHoteling\nDesk Bookings. When the department's approving manager is not required to approve bookings and SendEmailtoOccupiers is enabled, the notification will\nnow send upon booking creation, and it will be a consolidated notification for recurring bookings. In the case that the department's approving manager is required\nto approve bookings, then the notifications will wait for individual approvals, with individual notifications sent at that time. (AD-9250)\nWorkplace Utilization Report. Highlighting the floor plan no longer produces inconsistent results. (AD-9513)\nArchibus\u00a0Help known limitations\n\nNon-English help from the Navigator. If you use the right-click Help command on a Navigator process, you will receive an error message that the topic cannot\nbe found. This is because the localized version of Archibus Help does not contain topics at this level of detail. In a future release, the right-click Help command\nwill load the appropriate topic from the English version of Archibus Help. (AD-2786)\nArchibus SaaS known limitations\nSAML SSO . Customers using SAML SSO using Shibboleth SP and request-header Spring security config, who also wish to use REST APIs and/or the OnSite\nmobile app, will need to provision a second instance of WebCentral to support REST APIs, as the request-header Spring security config breaks JWT token\nauthentication\nUser AFM-MOD. Navigator missing some Risk applications. When you sign in as sample user AFM-MOD, you should access all applications licensed for\nSaaS. However, the Emergency Preparedness, Sustainability Assessment, Health & Safety, Hazard Abatement, Hazardous Materials, Waste, and Green\nBuilding modules are missing from the Navigator. If you need to see these modules when signed in as AFM-MOD, you can assign them and unassign some\nothers. In the future, the Navigator will be able to display all modules assigned to AFM-MOD at one time. (AD-6967)\nHome Page Publishing. SaaS Partner Administrator. If you sign in as a SaaS Partner Administrator (such as sample user AFM-BP), run the System / SaaS\nPartner Administrator / Manage Home Pages and Processes task, modify a home page, and publish your changes; you receive an error message. As a\nworkaround: use System / Add-In Manager / Publish Home Pages by Role to publish home pages after modifying them. (APP-6426)\nMobile Framework known limitations\nFail to log in again when reloading mobile client. iOS. If you log in, close mobile client, and then attempt to log in again, you will find that you cannot log in.\nThe failure stems from being already logged into the OIDC connector and trying to reestablish a session. IOS has not been fully upgraded for service workers\ndue to extra restrictions service workers have in IOS Safari. Therefore IOS still requires the connection checks. A workaround is to wait until the OIDC session is\ninvalid/logged out, as well as not selecting \"remember me\" (for example in Okta) while on IOS. Not closing the app while there is a valid session will avoid this\nissue entirely. This is not an issue for Android. (AD-6517)\nSurveys. Measurement questions. Android. With the survey (questionnaire) features in both Maintenance and Compliance Surveys mobile apps, users can\nenter non-numeric values for Measurement questions. These values do not correctly upload when the mobile apps are synced. A future version will add\nvalidation so that users can input only numbers as the answer of Measurement type questions. (AD-4600)\nWeb Central known limitations\nSigning Back in After a Time Out. If your session expires and you sign back in, when you click anything on the Navigator, you will receive an error message.\nThe workaround is to refresh the browser page. (AD-10570, AD-10602)\nBIM\u00a0Viewer. Sample Data. In the sample HQ\u00a0project, building HQ loads as a floor plan instead of a model. This occurs because in our Forge account, we have a\nCAD drawing that is linked to building HQ. This will be corrected in the future. (AD-9585)\nReport Central. Charts. In order to see more of the chart, you might attempt to resize the grid panel and find that you cannot resize it. In this case, you can hide\nthe filter, and then scroll the region to see the entire chart. (AD-9149)\nImages. Firefox. When images have a larger vertical size than horizontal size (a portrait image), they may appear distorted on Firefox. This is not an issue for\nother Web browsers. (AD-7140)\nSelect Values. Floors. For view 2.0 views that have a filter that includes the Floor Code field, the view may not show all available floors. The root cause is that\nthe core UI grid control determines the number of pages based on the number of index records. For the Floor selector, the index uses the Building Code, i.e.\nthere are 111 buildings with floors. Thus, the grid shows only two pages of floor records (one page = 100 records). (AD-3706)\nMenu options hidden. When a view title is too long, the top menu actions (User Menu, User Help, Add to Favorites) and client logo are not visible. (AD-4820)\nNavigator. Non-English Locale. If you launch Web Central from the Smart Client and are using a non-English locale, the Web Central Navigator will not display\nyour applications and tasks. (AD-3866)\nPolish characters in V.25.x user interface. With the V.25.1 user interface refresh, special characters in UI titles translated to Polish do not appear like the other\ncharacters. For customers who have this issue, we recommend modifying all CSS files in the \\schema\\ab-core\\views\\navigator folder to replace this line: font-\nfamily: \"Open Sans\";\nwith this line: font-family: \"Open Sans\", Arial; (AD-2292)\nQuestionnaires. Non-English. Questionnaires, such as those in Condition Assessment and Sustainability Assessment, do not allow assessors to edit out-of-\nthe-box, sample questions that have been localized from English (US) to other languages. The workaround is for Archibus Administrators to use Archibus Smart\nClient to edit the text of these sample questions. This issue affects only sample data questionnaires that have been localized from English. (AD-1547)\nExtended Questionnaires. Document/Photo. The Web Central questionnaire form (for both Compliance and Maintenance) does not currently support\nrespondent-initiated submission of more than one document/photo attachment per question, whether or not the questionnaire designer specifies a value greater\nthan 1 for Maximum Number Responses. The mobile app does support this feature. You cannot delete the uploaded document after Save the question-answer;\nthere is no action when clicking the X button. A questionnaire designer should take this into account when designing forms. (APP-2426, AD-4431)\nIf the intended respondents will be using Web Central to submit documents and flexibility in number of document responses is desired, then the designer\ncan work around the limitation by defining a parent question containing a follow-up question of type document and allow multiple instances of the parent\nquestion.\nFor example, parent question could be multiple choice \"attach a document?\" Yes/No. If Yes, then the application shows the document question as a\nfollow-up. Set up the \"Attach a document\" question to allow multiple answers, such that the respondent can add another, answer \"Yes\" and so on.\nHome Page Editor. Maps. When creating home pages, you add only one map bucket to each home page. (WC-2790)\nHome Pages. Localized. For some international users, home pages may display English titles for columns in the Metric Trends panel. If this issue occurs, the\nuser can switch to a different home page and go back, or sign out and sign in again. (WC-2373)\nGrid. Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) fields. If working with a view in which you define highlight patterns (such as Space / Space Inventory / Background\nData / Define Division and Department Highlight Patterns, ab-sp-create-dp-hatch.axvw), and you set a gradient highlight, create a swatch bitmap, and refresh the\nview, the Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) field will not correctly show the swatch bitmap for the gradient highlight. Instead, the fields show the same color for all\ngradient highlight definitions. (WC-2748)\nGrid 3.0. Grid Control 3.0, which is used in views such as PM Planner (ab-pm-planner.axvw) and Service Console (ab-request-console.axvw), presents an error\nif you try to sort by a field that is not from the main table. (AD-8474)\nSchema Change Wizard. Oracle. When using Schema Change Wizard on an Oracle database, you may face the error ORA-01031: insufficient privileges when\nchoosing to re-create any of the Archibus security tables: afm_users; afm_groups. Resolution: Choose \"Alter existing table structures (preserves additional\nfields)\" option when trying to update afm_users/afm_groups tables. (3045736)\nSmart Client known limitations\nNavigator. With a non-SaaS license, logging in to the Smart Client as AFM incorrectly produces a Navigator that includes an Archibus SaaS process. (AD-3794)\nSAML. Connecting to SAML requires user to make server selection on subsequent sign-ins. (AD-1996)\nCertificate Authentication. Web Central tasks. Cannot data transfer or launch Web Central if Certificate Authentication is in effect. (SMAR-626)\nEditing standards tables. If you edit Furniture Standards or Equipment Standards with the default database, the titles for the Length and Width fields will show\nincorrectly as \"ft\" or \"M\". If you log in with a different locale (e.g. view an Imperial project as a Metric user) the program will convert the values. The condition also\noccurs in Furniture or Equipment Standards views loaded in Web Central. To avoid this condition in both environments, load the Archibus Fields table (afm_flds),\nfind the Length and Width fields, and change their Numeric Format from \"Length\" to \"Default\". (3037311)\nDeleting a record with a date/time field as part of its primary key. You are unable to delete records from tables that have a date/time field as part of the\nprimary key, such as the ehs_medical_mon_results table. There are no such errors when deleting records from the same table in Web Central views. (WC-2169)\nDeleting. hwr and hwo tables. It is not possible to delete records from Smart Client grid views that present these tables. As a work-around, delete the records\nfrom Web Central. (SMAR-596)\nDeleting. Bulk Editing. Currently there is no way of bulk deleting data from Smart Client. If you select all records and then hit Delete, only those records\ncurrently displayed on screen are deleted; all of the other records that are selected but not on screen remain. As a work-around, in View Definition Wizard, create\na single panel interactive report for the table in question, choose only the primary key field(s) unless you need to add a restriction. In the preview pane, enable\n\nadvanced editing, and add multipleSelectionEnabled=\u201dtrue\u201d in the panel, then insert a panel action with a command type deleteSeletedRows.\nSave Changes and preview the view and you can check all and delete right from the preview, without needing to save/publish it. (SMAR-17)\nRibbon. The Smart Client ribbon is very small on high resolution monitors. (SMAR-503)\nGrid. Refresh when filtering. After you set and clear a filter, the grid does not correctly update record counts and refresh. As a workaround, run the Clear action\non the menu ribbon. (SMAR-609)\nReplace Column. When there are more than two tables in the standard role attached to the Smart Client grid view, the command presents errors. (SMAR-528)\nModified views cannot be saved as default view. Log in as a user that has the Security group SYS-VIEW-ALTER (such as AFMX), open a view, change the\nview, save, and make it the default view. Reload, and the default view will not reflect your changes. (SMAR-329)\nExplorer pane. Recent Views list. When you create new views and save them in the Explorer's list of recent views, you can save up to 8 views. When you save\nthe ninth view, the system removes the newest view from the list. It should remove the oldest view from the list. (SMAR-907)\nData Transfer. Dates deleted from the output file are not cleared in the database after transferring in the file with the changes made. (SMAR-671)\nSmart Client Extension for AutoCAD\u00a0known limitations\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nInsert Asset. The Insert Asset logic doesn\u2019t take into account the AssetTypeDetail.ParameterUnits value when inserting the asset. Therefore, in a\ndrawing with Imperial/Architectural units, running the Insert Asset command on the RM layer inserts the asset in inches rather than feet. (AD-7470)\nQuery Table. The Query Table command does not include fields that contribute to the primary key; for example, it does not show the Building Code and Floor\nCode values for rooms. (SMAR- 798)\nHighlighting commands\nUnclosed polylines. If some areas don't highlight with solid highlights, they might be open not closed polylines. If so, close them. The AutoCAD solids\ndon't fill unclosed-closed polylines. AutoCAD hatch patterns do, however. Notice that if you have multiple areas of one type (e.g. Office standard), having\none unclosed polyline may cause others to also not have a solid fill (since Archibus hatches many of them in one go for efficiency's sake). (3030818)\nHatch patterns. The Archibus-defined patterns (from the .pat file) are not being loaded into AutoCAD at the time of highlighting. Only the out-of-the-box\nAutoCAD patterns work as expected because the highlighting logic defaults to a SOLID hatch pattern if it can't find the pattern definition. (SMAR-902)\nLarge floor plans. When dealing with very large floor plans (3,500 rooms on a single floor), commands like Catalog Layer and Highlight by Department do not\ngive progress feedback, but function correctly.\nAsset Text Height. The Smart Client Extension ignores the atxt_ht_in and atxt_ht_cm in favor of the atxt_ht value, which is in inches. For metric drawings the\nSCE converts this to cm. (SMAR-189)\nEdit Data. Suite areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0.\nIf you press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nTrial layers. Asset text. Asset text is left-justified instead of center-justified. (SMAR-492)\nExplorer window. Anchoring. When you open a drawing from within the Smart Client drawings list, the Explorer window should be positioned according to the\nsettings made in the previous session; instead, it opens in the floating position and you must reset it.(SMAR-702)\nDrawing Publishing\u00a0\nAutoCAD Leader objects. EMF does not support arrows or text with the leaders. SVG supports only solid arrows. (3044919)\nSecondary circulation areas as regions. As documented in\nhttps://www.archibus.net/ai/abizfiles/v23_help/archibus_help/user_en/archibus.htm#../Subsystems/webc/Content/web_user/space/concepts/open_plan.htm,\nyou can draw accurate polylines for secondary circulation using AutoCAD REGIONS. Publishing these drawings may result in rooms being set incorrectly\nin front of or behind other rooms. In order for rooms within a secondary circulation region to be shown and highlighted in front of the secondary circulation\nspace in a published drawing, they must be numbered higher than the secondary circulation space. (3051186)\nXREF The XREF Layer does not publish when the TURNOFFALL* value is specified in the additional layers field. As a workaround, turn off layers\nindividually and do not use the TURNOFFALL* feature to control XREF Layers.(SMAR-1001)\nAFM_NET_LISP \"Publish\" command. Ignores the viewWindow attribute when the publishType is EMF and the generated file is published to extents.\n(SMAR-737).\nSVG. Background Color. If you set the Set the ColorMapping field to BLACK for AbPubBackground in the sample HQ database and publish, the black\nbackground does not appear to take effect. This is because there are multiple active rules in the database, and later results overwrite the earlier ones. To\nresolve this either (a) set the Active flag to No for all of the SVG files except for one; or, (b) specify a unique Rule Suffix (e.g. -bl, -reg, -eq) for each rule,\nexcept for the one that has a Color Mapping value so that different rules will produce different output files. (SMAR-417)\nSVG. Hatches. Complex hatches, meaning that there are multiple polylines that are used as the boundaries for the hatch, do not publish to SVG; whereas\nhatches that do successfully publish are contained in a single polyline. You can separate the hatches using HATCHEDIT, and the publishing will work as\nexpected. (SMAR-513)\nRefreshing. Firefox. If your workstation uses Firefox and you load a drawing's enterprise graphics in Web Central or in the Smart Client, then republish\nthat drawing's enterprise graphics, the change may not appear when you reload the view with the enterprise graphics. For performance reasons, some\nversions of Firefox do not immediately refresh the enterprise graphics files from their local cache even when the file has a later time stamp, as checking\nthe time stamp involves an extra query to the server for each file. To view your changes, clear your cache or restart your browser. If you wish to see\nchanges immediately without clearing your cache, you can change your browser cache settings to control the problem.\n1. In Firefox's menu, select Tools >\u00a0Options.\n2. Select the Advanced tab, and then the Network tab.\n3. In the Offline Storage section, enter 0 for the MB of space used for the cache.(3024655)\nSmart Client Extension for Revit known limitations\nInstaller. The installer does not enable Smart Client Extensions for Revit and AutoCAD. This was found to occur on AutoCAD 2023 and Revit 2022. The\nworkaround is to enable the Smart Client Extensions for AutoCAD or Revit by loading the Smart Client, accessing the Preferences command, and setting the\nCAD\u00a0Application and AutoCAD Profile options. (AD-10759)\nUncatalog. With Revit 2022 running on Windows 11, you cannot select Asset Type on the Uncatalog form. (AD-10027)\nFile names with special characters. When you publish a Revit file whose file name contains spaces and characters such as #+\u00b0$(), you may receive an error\nmessage when viewing the SVG file in Web Central. (WC-3132)\nOpening a model. Error message. Due to the way that Updater classes are implemented, Revit presents a message that you are missing a third-party updater.\nYou can ignore this message. (SMAR-974).\nNumber.\nIf you Number a room and then use the Smart Client to show the Room field \"Perimeter ft\u201d, the perimeter shows as 0. If you Data Edit or Data Edit\nMultiple, the number is corrected. (SMAR-285)\nIf the database does not contain enough information for the Number command to execute, it fails to number instead of providing feedback to the user\nabout what database information is needed to successfully run the command. (SMAR-526)\nDeleting rooms. Revit does not notify Archibus when Revit deletes rooms. Currently, Archibus cannot uncatalog rooms on that event. Use the Synchronization /\nUncatalog Records without Assets command to clear the Drawing Name and Id fields on these rooms in one step.\nWeb Query. If the last primary key value for an asset is a single digit (e.g. if you query for room \"1\"), then the pop up dialog results are not restricted to that one\nrecord. This doesn't occur for two- and three-digit IDs (e.g. room \"10\" or \"100\"). (3035367, 3035366, 3034950, 3034414)\nPublish Enterprise Graphics. Colors. Since Revit floor plans do not have color, colors for Enterprise Graphics generated from Revit can cause confusion,\nespecially since the user does not have control over this. In a future release, Archibus will address this issue. (SMAR-988)\nEdit Data\u00a0\nRooms. Some objects in linked models are not correctly picking up room codes of the rooms they are inside of. (SMAR-785)\nGroup Areas. For new groups, the Group Code will show as \"1\" until the record is actually saved. Thereafter, the proper autonumbered ID will show.\n(3034828)\n\nSuite Areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0. If\nyou press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nLong parameter values. If you have a parameter value (e.g. Name) mapped to an Archibus field (e.g. Option 1), and that parameter has an existing\nvalue longer than the field width in Archibus, then you will not be able to create a record using Edit Data. You can shorten the parameter value using the\nRevit Parameters dialog. Alternately, if you use the Archibus Catalog command, the command will find all of these conditions and allow you to rectify them\nindividually or in groups. (3034793)\nMap Database Fields. This form is empty if there are no assets in the model of the specified asset type. (3034357)\nCopy / Paste. If you copy and paste furniture and equipment, you also copy and paste their Revit properties. Use the Archibus synchronization commands to\nfind and resolve any duplicates. (3030989)\nOutlook Plugin known limitations\nRegistry Entry to Keep Enabled. To ensure the Plugin cannot be disabled by users and will not be disabled automatically by Outlook, the following DWORD\nregistry value, which is added by the standard installer,\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=dword:1\nshould be replaced by a string value\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\x.0\\Outlook\\Resiliency\\AddinList]\n\"ArchibusOutlookPlugin\"=\"1\"\nThis replacement can be implemented by customizing the Outlook Plugin MSI installer with a customization tool such as Master Packager. (AD-10391)\nSystem Administration known limitations\nBMS\u00a0Integration. The Technologies / Innovative Solutions / Integrations - BMS / Configure BMS Analysis (ab-iot-bms-configure-analysis.axvw) view has an \"add\nnew\" option which is not functioning. (AD-7901)\nSecurity. LDAP. The result of using a distinguished name with a comma results in this error in archibus.log: \"LDAP: error code 49 - Invalid Credentials\". The\nsolution is to change the bind user's \"CN=\" value to a name that does not contain a comma. (3037258)\nSecurity. SSO. In SSO mode, when the user name is incorrect, the user is redirected to the timeout page instead of the SSO error page. (WC-2027)\nSolution Templates. IofT. The Technologies / Innovative Solutions /Integrations - IoT / IoT Space Utilization solution template is not Oracle-compatible. (AD-8296)\nSolution Templates. Calendar Control. The Reservations Calendar example records multiple days for one-day events. (WC-3237)\nConnectListener. When ConnectListener runs, it does not move the previous afm_conn_log entries to afm_conn_logh. (AD-7003)\nSchema Change Wizard. The archibus.log fails to show correctly field and table name in the global dataset. This is only a logging issue. There is no functional\nerror. (3033565)\nGrid. API. Grid panels can display custom values calculated in Java Script code. An example can be seen in the following view. This example displays the\ncustom Location field that is composed from Building, Floor, Room, and Location database fields. The example also includes a menu that allows the user to\nproduce reports with the grid data. Due to Web Central technical implementation limitation, custom values formatted in Java Script code cannot be displayed in\nthese reports. (3041685)\nPath: Technologies / User Interface Add-Ins / Assemblies with Multiple Panels / Find-Manage with Categories\nFile: ab-products\\solutions\\assemblies\\work-wizard\\ab-ex-work-wizard.js\nFunction: updateLocations()\nGrid. API. When designing views with a grid panel, you cannot set specific grid column width in pixels. The grid automatically sets column widths according to\nthe available space and the data displayed in each column. (3045398)\nGrid. API. The Clear Filter icon is not visible if the last grid column is hidden. To avoid the issue, add an empty last column. The condition does not affect any of\nthe Archibus applications. (3040363)\nDatabase known limitations\nDatabase Update Wizard. runDuw.sql script. The Database Update Wizard generates an SQL script called runDuw.sql. When writing this file, it does not\nreplace macros with SQL. (AD-10595)\nafm_ptasks table. Missing Translation for \"Configure Application Parameters for CAD and BIM\" task. This task is not translated. You can enter it yourself\nin the afm_ptasks table using these values: (AD-10583)\nChinese: \u4e3a CAD \u548c BIM \u914d\u7f6e\u5e94\u7528\u53c2\u6570\nDutch: Toepassingsparameters configureren voor CAD en BIM\nFrench: Configurer les param\u00e8tres d\u2019application pour la CAO et le BIM\nGerman: Anwendungsparameter f\u00fcr CAD und BIM konfigurieren\nItalian: Configurare parametri applicazione per CAD e BIM\nSpanish: Configurar par\u00e1metros de aplicaci\u00f3n para CAD y BIM\nafm_ptasks table.

Chinese. Push notifications are not yet supported for Chinese. (ON-1058)\nNotifications. Oracle. With an Oracle deployment, you cannot receive notification from OnSite; if you check the Web Central Notifications Log view, you will not\nsee any messages sent from OnSite. (ON-1237)\nNotifications. Time Zones. Notification date/time is not set against mobile device's timezone and work request's location, but is set against the server's\ntimezone and location. (ON-1230)\nNew requests. Cannot See. After you create a new request, you may not see it in the Request List because it is added to the end of the request list. You can\nuse the pull-to-refresh feature to re-sort the requests according to the \u201corder by\u201d option.(ON-487)\nWork Request List. Updating. When you create a new request, it is added to the bottom of the list because the sort order of work requests is not updating to\nreflect a new request. Pulling to refresh solves this issue.(ON-723)\nMobile App known limitations\nCompliance Surveys. Questionnaires. If a questionnaire requires a service request and the service request is created and then deleted, the questionnaire will\nstill indicate the service request step is complete. (AD-9047)\nMaintenance. Resources. If you add resources, such as parts, tools, and costs, you will not see the new resource records in both Resource Details form. Thus,\nyou might think the resource records were not added. After syncing, you will see that the resource record were successfully added. (AD-5908)\nMaintenance. Checklists. Android 11. If you try to create a request from a work request's checklist, you receive a blank screen. This occurs only on Android 11.\n(AD-5863)\nMaintenance. Stopping Work. Supervisors cannot stop a work request that has a pending checklist. (AD-4883)\n\nMaintenance. Reopening a Checklist when Verifying It. If a supervisor reopens a checklist during the verify process, the work request correctly moves back to\nthe Issued status. If this work request's checklist is still pending and the supervisor or craftsperson now selects multiple work requests to complete (including this\none), you will find that you can complete this work request despite the fact that it has an open checklist. The issue does not occur when working from the My\nWork form because the form does not support multi-select action. (AD-4882)\nMaintenance. Confirmation. SLAs can contain Confirmation steps on the \"Issued\" and \"Completed\" statuses. Users who are assigned to these steps can\nperform the confirmation (Approve/Reject/Cancel) in the Maintenance Console, but this feature is not supported in the mobile Maintenance app. Confirmation\nsteps work only on the \"Requested\" and \"Assigned to Work Order\" statuses on mobile. (AD-7267)\nMaintenance. Redlines. If you turn off data access (mobile and wifi) on the device, you are not able to access the redline feature. (AD-10909)\nMaintenance. Sync Issues.\nWhen a user performs a Sync action on the mobile Maintenance app, any craftspersons hours data (such as Actual Hours or Overtime Hours) can be\noverwritten if those hours were entered in Web Central. (3045897)\nWhen a requestor reports multiple maintenance requests of the same type from different locations and then syncs to upload all the requests at once, the\nmobile app does not consistently upload all the requests. To avoid this problem, sync after entering each request. (3048805).\nPart quantities are synced on the mobile Maintenance app only when you sync the background data. This affects mobile users who perform any of the\nfollowing actions on the mobile maintenance application:\no Estimate parts on a work request\no Add purchased parts to inventory\no Complete a work request that includes parts\nAfter you perform any of these actions and sync, the system will update the part quantities correctly in the database and they will appear correctly in Web\nCentral; however, the mobile application will not show these new quantities. Also, any changes made by other mobile users or Web Central users to the\npart quantities will not be synced. The workaround is to go the Sync settings on the mobile application and click the button that says \u201cReset Background\nData Sync Flag\u201d. When you return to the Maintenance application, the background data will automatically sync, and the part quantities will be updated on\nthe device. (3053237)\nMaintenance. Seeing Rejected Requests. Approvers can reject requests back to the requestor or step completer. However, mobile users cannot see or\nresubmit those rejected requests from the mobile application. This must be done from the Building Operations Console.(3048370)\nMaintenance. Photos. You can request maintenance from the Workplace Services Portal app and the Maintenance app, and you can update maintenance\nrequests from the Maintenance app. However, the two apps store maintenance photos in different tables (wr and activity_log), which can cause problems when\nediting or deleting a photo. When you request maintenance using the Workplace Services Portal app and add a photo, and then access the corresponding work\nrequest using the Maintenance app, the photo will be shown. However, if later the photo is deleted by the Maintenance team from the work request (wr) record,\nthe photo will not be deleted from the activity_log record, and vice versa. There are several alternative scenarios for adding, changing, or deleting photos which\nmay cause this kind of issue. This issue will be fixed in a future release. (3047423)\nWorkplace Portal. Chinese. If you enter a space after a Building Code value, you will encounter an error with Rooms/ Locate Employee. (AD-5913)\nWorkplace known limitations\nService Catalog. Accessibility Mode. If Accessibility Mode is enabled, the ..archibus/schema/ab-products/essential/workplace/index.html?\naction=servicecatalog URL displays the pre-V2022.02 Service Catalog view and does not display the Dashboard, as is the behavior for V2022.02 and beyond\nwithout Accessibility Mode. (AD-8901)\nUI Issues\nOn the Calendar view, team member names lack proper spacing, and names and titles are obscured by the calendar grid. (AD-10424)\nThe People and Places view has truncated text. (AD-9578)\nComment text does not wrap properly. (AD-10444)\nCheck In. New visitors. In the Calendar view, under Workspaces Booked for Others, there is no Check In button for visitors. (AD-10536)\nComments. On the Requests details page, it is possible to click on the Comments, not enter anything, and save. Saving an empty comment should not be\npossible. (AD-10439)\nComments. It is possible for a user to edit or delete comment created by another user. (AD-10434)\nEmployee Move Request. When you create an employee move request from Workplace and then view the request in Web Central (View Service Request\ntask), you may find that there is ncorrect or missing data. (AD-10440)\nTablet. Mobile browser. Meeting Space Booking Time. The following behavior was observed with Samsung Galaxy Tab A with Android 11 in portrait view: the\nnavigation buttons cover the Time selection fields. As a workaround, turning the device to Landscape orientation and you can select values for the two fields.\nReturning to Portrait orientation allows the user to continue with navigation. (AD-10617)\niPad Pro.\nPeople & Places. UI. The email address in the right panel is not properly displayed. (AD-9466)\nApplication Freezes. If you are in the process of using Workplace and close the device screen, Workplace freezes and you cannot continue your\noperation upon your return. (AD-9469)\nDesk Bookings\nTeams. With HotelBookingRestrictions set for Team, not all team members are shown when booking a desk. Only the names of the logged-in user\nand one team member are listed, the names of the other team members are not listed, nor are they found when searching for them. (AD-10674)\nHighlighted available seats. From the Workspace Booking page, all available, hotelable workspaces are not highlighted on the floor plan. (AD-10099)\nDepartment and Room Type filter. If you choose a Department filter first and then a Room Type filter, in that order, then the drawing will not show\navailable seats. You can remove the Department filter to see available seats. (AD-10343)\nVisitor. When you make a workspace booking for a new Visitor, the Visitor Department is not saved. (AD-9016)\nRooms without Room Categories. The Create and Review Bookings view may show fewer rooms available for a building than a user might expect IF\nrooms have been flagged as bookable but do not have a Room Category associated with them. Since hotelable rooms should be in occupiable space,\nand since Room Categories are required to indicate occupiable space, those users who are defining hotelable rooms will want to check that all rooms\ndefined as hotelable include a Room Category value. In a future release the Define Hotelable Rooms view might be updated to enforce that requirement.\n(AD-4915)\nBooking Multiple Seats. Floor Capacity Target. When the application is set up such that AbSpaceHotelling-AllowMultipleBookings is set to\nYes and AbSpaceHotelling-EnforceFloorCapacityTarget is set to Yes, when users encounter a room with more than 1 seat available, they have\nthe option to book multiple seats in their own name. However, users can book up to the total number of available seats in this room, even if it exceeds the\nFloor Capacity Target set for this floor. They will be able to proceed with the booking and exceed the Floor Capacity Target. The next person who tries to\nbook on the floor, however, will be prevented from making any further bookings. (AD-7498).\nMeeting Room Reservations\nSelf-booking. QR\u00a0Codes. When the self-booking a meeting room is not permitted (SelfServiceBookMeetingSpace = 0,\nKioskBookMeetingSpace = 0) you will find that after scanning the QR code label, the Book button is displayed. It should be hidden based on the\nparameter settings. (AD-9683)\nUnavailable rooms. On the Meeting Space Booking page, a room that is completely booked on the selected date is not showing as unavailable. The\nroom should be greyed out on the floor plan and hidden from the List view. (AD-10379)\nFully Occupied Rooms. Accessibility Mode.In Accessibility mode, Workplace does not correctly handle fully occupied meeting room for a specific date.\n(AD-10452)\nMultiple Room Configurations. In Workplace, we assume that only one configuration and one room arrangement has been defined for a room. If you\ncreate multiple room configurations with the Reservations application, the configurations will appear in Workplace, but there is no distinguishing\ninformation about the configurations and the user will not know which space they are reserving. There will also appear to be a discrepancy between the\navailable room count and the number of rooms shown on the floor plan. (AD-835, APP-5194, APP-5845)\n\nRecurrence Pattern. Workspace reservations do not show recurrence patterns in the details view. You can only delete a single occurrence at a time. AD-\n835)\nTime Slots. Meeting space requests do not honor the value of the parameter in AbWorkplaceReservations-MinutesTimeUnit. You can only select\ntime intervals in 30-minute blocks. (AD-7010)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nSkip to Available Rooms redundant message. When you access the Meeting Space Booking page, you receive the \"Skip to Available Rooms\"\nmessage, which is not necessary. (AD-10264)\nMeeting Room Reservations.Today not shown. If you book a meeting room daily beginning today and then create a booking of the same meeting room\nfor a weekly recurrence pattern with a date frame which includes some days of the previous booking, the result will not list today and will not show the\nproper duration. (AD-10115)\nQR Codes. The Home button is not available after scanning a QR code, and from QR Code page, it is difficult to navigate to the login screen. (AD-9659, AD-\n9681)\nFloor Selection. Accessibility Mode. The floor selector buttons are replaced with drop-down lists. In both modes, Workplace should use floor selector\nbuttons. (AD-9844)\nMeeting Reservation. You cannot change Start Time or Duration from the selected value to note; you can change only to other available Start times or\nDurations. As a workaround, click Cancel and start over. (AD-9554)\nSigning in. Android. You cannot log in if not using Mobile Client 4.0. As a workaround, upgrade to Mobile Client 4.0. (AD-6801)\nIcon and Title. On iPhones and iPads, the main page listing all your apps has the wrong icon and title for the Workplace app. (AD-8653)\nHeader and Footer. On iPhone 12, the header of the application is cut so that you cannot access buttons located at the top of the screen, such as \"My\nAccount\" or \"Cancel\" buttons. (AD-7459)\nBlank Areas. We are working on problems of extra blank areas appearing in various screens of the Workplace mobile app. (AD-8258).\nSearching. Dismiss Keyboard. If you search and then dismiss the keyboard, the screen area that the keyboard occupied remains blank. (AD-8227, AD-\n8006)\nSelect Occupants for Workspace Booking. If you try to book six or more staff for working space, the UI cannot correctly display you selected\nemployees. (AD-8599)\nWorkplace Services known limitations\nService Desk known limitations\nManage Request Types. Non-English Locale. When using the Service Desk / Service Desk Manager / Manage Request Types view (ab-create-activitytype-\ntabs.axvw) to edit request types that have been translated into other locales, the request type does not appear correctly in Service Desk Manager edit form. (AD-\n2813)\nReservations known limitations\nReservations Calendar Console. Room Arrangement. If you edit a reservation and change the room arrangement, you receive an error message.\nWorkaround: Instead of clicking on the room row, and then changing the arrangement as a second step, click first on the arrangement selection without first\nselecting the room, this way, you can select any arrangement. (AD-10233)\nReservations Calendar Console. Attendees in Room. Does not correctly set the \u201cAttendees in Room\u201d field value when creating meetings; there is no way for\na user to manually edit this value. (AD-4856)\nReservations Calendar Console. Double-byte Characters and Comments Field. The Calendar Console presents an error message when you attempt to\nconfirm a reservation whose comment includes double-byte characters and is larger than 4000 characters. As a workaround, enter smaller comments when a\ncomment includes double-byte characters. (AD-436)\nReservations Calendar Console. Recurring Reservations for Monthly Meetings. The timeline does not always correctly display recurring patterns for\nmonthly meetings. For example, if you created a reservation for the first Monday of the month, the Reservations Calendar Console might show all Mondays in\nthe month. Although the timeline might not display these reservations correctly, the Console does correctly save these meeting dates and the summary text\nreflects the proper date. (APP-6651)(AD-1028)\nReservations Calendar Console. Room Configurations. For situations in which multiple reservations exist at the same time in the same room, but for different\nroom configurations, the calendar displays only one reservation. (APP-6561)\nReservations Calendar Console. Continuous Meetings. The system does not prompt you resolve continuous meetings that have conflicts; when it encounters\nthis situation, the system generates a workflow rule error. (APP-6535)\nReservations Calendar Console. Conference Calls.\nIf you create a conference call and you select several buildings in order to select rooms in several buildings; and if many of the rooms in one building are\nreservable, all of the rooms for this building are shown, and reservable rooms from other buildings are not displayed. This can make hard to select rooms\nfrom different buildings. The TimelineMaxRoomsPerBuilding application parameter does not control this.(APP-6214)\nYou cannot edit the date and time of a conference call reservation. (APP-6613)\nReservations Calendar Console. Changing Room Selection.Time not Recorded. If you select a room, select a time, add some resources, and select\nanother room; you will find that the designated time does not persist to the second room. (APP-6800)\nReservations Calendar Console. Application Parameters. The TimelineStartTime and TimelineEndTime parameters work only with one-hour\nincrements. If you enter times such as 9:30 and 17:30 in the parameters, the Calendar Console does not consider them. (APP-6698)\nCreate Resource Reservation. Reservation Timeline. Microsoft Surface. You cannot drag with touch input a reservation on the timeline. Timeline drag-and-\ndrop supports only mouse events. (APP-3312)\nOutlook Plugin. My Reservations. When the Outlook Plugin displays the My Reservations, the popup is opened without the option to edit any of the\nreservations showed, so users cannot add resources. The Add Reservation button is also disabled. (AD-4846)\nGoogle Calendar Integration. When you have configured the application for \"no integration\" with Exchange, the .ics files that are generated to be imported into\nOutlook, Google Calendar, or any other calendar app, sometimes do not correctly update the Google Calendar application. Specifically, there can be a problem\nwith the file content related to the meeting identifiers created by the application. These meeting identifiers are not always unique. If you create a new calendar,\ninstead of importing an existing one, the creation of meetings seems to work correctly for single and recurring reservations, but updates and cancellations don\u2019t\nalways work as expected.\nSpace known limitations\nView and Print Floor Plan.\nWith an Oracle database, loading the building list takes over a minute to load. This is much longer than loading in other environments. (AD-10426)\nIf Room Category and Room Type have the same value, only value is displayed in the drawing. (AD-10178)\nSpace Console. Bulk editing rooms. If you select from the floor plan more than 10 rooms and attempt to bulk-edit them, the form may not display all the fields\nand buttons making it difficult or impossible to edit the selected rooms. When editing rooms in bulk, edit fewer than 10 rooms at one time. (AD-2711)\nSpace Console. Generate Ad Hoc PDF. Large Drawings. For large drawings, such as one with an SVG size of 5590K, the report may not generate. In these\ncases, increase the memory, such as increasing the Tomcat memory to 2048 M. (AD-2048)\nSpace Console. Export Drawing to PDF. Drawing Units of mm. If you are using mm as units in your drawing, when you try to export to PDF, you will likely run\nout of memory. To resolve this, you can increase the java heap, or use meters or centimeters as units. (AD-8717)\nSpace Console. Employees tab. Selecting Employees. If you have a list of employees that runs over multiple pages, when you select employees and then\nmove to \"Next\" or \"Previous\" page, the selection will be cleared. As a workaround, you can first use the \"Place Employee in Waiting Room\" or \"Unassign\" action\nfor the selected employees on the current page, and then move to a different page to select additional employees. (AD-2741)\nSpace Console. Team Space. Organization Name field. When assigning associations to teams, you will see that the Associations tab includes the\nOrganization Name field. This is validated by the Organizational Units (org) table. To create the values for the Organizational Units table so that they are\n\navailable when completing the Organization Name field, you must use the Smart Client. Create a new view that holds the org table and use this view to define\nyour organizational units. (3052882)\nSpace Console. Plan Types. Using Plan Types on the Space Console affords the user the ability to personalize highlights, text labels, and printed legends to\nthe deployment's needs, in addition to the pre-existing highlights and label options that exist on the Space Console's drop-down menus. The Add-In Manager\ndefines Plan Type highlights and labels by creating or modifying view files and datasources that are logged in the active_plantypes table. However, to make\nchanges or add legend datasources, in addition to defining those datasources in the view file that active_plantypes references, the Add-In manager must:\n1. Make an associated change in the same view file for a highlight datasource, and name it as the legend is named. For example, if the Add-In Manager\nmakes a legend datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend\", they must also make an associated highlight datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-\nhl-rm-by-dp-name_rmHighlight\".\n2. In the PDF export AXVW file ab-sp-console-export-drawing-pdf.axvw, the Add-in Manager must also create a legend-type panel and refer to the\nnew legend datasource. Following the same example, the panel's id must be named panel_ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend, and the\ndatasource must equal ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend. The fields that the datasource defines and that should be visible in the legend must\nbe defined in that panel. (3050005)\nSpace Requests. Moves. If you change the From Location in a space request, use Space / Moves / Move Coordinator / Complete Group Moves to close the\nmove, and check the rmpct record, you will see that the value for primary_em is still 0. It should change to 1 since user has changed the From Location from\nsatellite location to primary location. The conditions for this situation are: workspace transactions are enabled, the SLA for Group Move calls for the service\nprovider as Move Management and no approvers, and the application parameters are: InferRoomDepartments=0 and\nAssignUnallocatedSpace=ProrateFloor. (3043629)\nMoves. Action Questionnaires. If you add new Action Types (using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Types task), you cannot add\nquestionnaires to these new action types using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Questionnaires task. (3028382)\nMaintenance known limitations\nChinese Locale. Tagging in Comments. When you tag someone in a comment using OnSite or WebCentral, the system generates an email; under a Chinese\nlocale, the strings in both email title and email body are not translated. Non-translated text includes: the string 'tagged you in work request' in both email title and\nemail body, as well as all the strings for work request parameters in email body. (AD-9394)\nTime Zones. You will encounter the wrong time zone in work orders (11:57 AM instead of 1:57 PM) if you select the \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value as the time zone using\nthe Define Geographical Locations view. Instead, select a city-specific time zone such as \"Europe/Paris timezone(UTC+1)\". The \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value will be\nremoved in the future as it is not necessary. (AD-8802)\nMaintenance Console. Japanese. Under a Japanese environment, the Maintenance Console's Comments are shifted to the right and do not properly align. (AD-\n10497)\nMaintenance Console. Report Problem Button. If the restrictLoadingOfUnassignedViews property is set to true in \\web-inf\\config\\security.properties, a\nuser with access to the Maintenance Console can be prevented from using the Report Problem button. This is a result of the Report Problem button calling a\nsecond view that is not listed in a process that is assigned to the user's role. To resolve this issue, add ab-bldgops-console-wr-create.axvw to the afm_ptasks\nprocess assigned to this user role. (AD-8377)\nMaintenance Console. Equipment Documents. Only the Add, Update, and Delete actions for working with documents should be controlled by the user role.\nCurrently, actions such as Show and Download are incorrectly controlled by user role.(AD-8299)\nCraftsperson Sample Data. In the sample HQ project, there are many records in Craftspersons (cf) table that do not have email account; also many have\nduplicated email accounts like no-response@archibustgd.com. The key convention for the workflow is: cf.email=em.email=afm_users.email. These\nvalues must be unique. To fix this issue, just remove those records from the cf table for which emails are either empty or have duplicated value. Below are some\nsituations where duplicated values can cause problems\nLaunch SLA console, dispatch to supervisor, click Select Value, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_supervisor=1\nContinue to add a estimation step, select employee to do estimation, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_estimator=1\nLaunch the Maintenance Console, click any work request, click the Forward button, select supervisor, you will see all employees instead of all meeting the\nrestriction: cf.is_supervisor=1.(AD-6744)\nCraftspersons. Notifications.For SLAs that are configured so craftspersons are to be notified when work is issued (notify craftsperson check-box), the\ncraftsperson is not receiving notification when the work is issued. (AD-4960)\nAssets known limitations\nAsset Lifecycle Console. Classification Filter. When you filter for a classification, in the Select Value list associated with the Classification filter, the\nClassifications tree expands automatically up to the second level. The returned classification results may be at lower levels, so you may need to manually\nexpand the tree to see everything. Ideally, the Asset Lifecycle Console would automatically expand to the appropriate level; however, it expands only to the\nsecond level due to potential performance issues on larger inventories of assets. ( AD-10324 )\nAsset Disposal Console. Changing Building Status from Asset Disposal Console Causes Inconsistencies in REPM. The Asset Disposal Console updates\nthe asset records for Buildings and Properties as well as inserts OT records to match when the asset is disposed of. REPM reports on Owned, Pipeline, and\nDisposed OT statuses for buildings, but ignores buildings with other ownership transaction statuses, or gives unexpected results in reports. The REPM Building\nAdd/Edit Wizard does not have a way to modify the status of the bl record. Setting the transaction Status to Owner does not change the status of the building to\nOwned. Coordinate OT records with asset status in both REPM and Disposal Console. (APP-852)\nDefine Classifications. Deleting Top Levels. In the Define Classification view (ab-ca-def-class.axvw, which is available from the Business Process\nOwner process of Asset Management, Condition Assessment, and Environmental Sustainability Assessment), you cannot delete a top level. Instead, you must\ndelete the top level by using Smart Client and deleting the record from the csi table. If you are not going to use a top-level classification hierarchy, it is advisable\nto delete all the child records (under the top level) before deleting the top level. (AD-6682)\nClassifications. Localization. Numeric ID (Automatic Lookup). The Classifications (csi) and Classification Standards (csi_std) tables are not translatable.\nTherefore, in order to use the Automatic Lookups (Numeric IDs) feature for asset classifications, enable Automatic Lookups for them without\nafm_scmpref.preferences. Otherwise, Archibus will look for the translatable fields in the two tables, resulting in application errors. Also, the Asset\nClassification Description field (csi.description) and the field Classification Standard Description (csi_std.description) are not translatable. If enabling\nthe Automatic Lookup for these fields, do not use the attribute displayType=\"translate\" because the fields are not translatable.(APP-4286) (AD-6683).\nEnterprise Assets known limitations\nProject Proposal Console. Baseline cost of a Billion Monetary Units or Greater. If you enter a baseline cost for an individual required asset that is a billion\nmonetary units or greater, you get an error that the value entered exceeds the maximum storage unit for the field. This is because the value for the baseline cost\nin the sb_items table is defined as numeric (9,1). However, the value you entered displays correctly in the grid and in the statistical summary because the value\nin the eq_req_items table is defined as numeric (16,2). This error occurs only in the rare case that the cost of an individual asset is a billion monetary units or\ngreater. (3052851)\nProject Proposal Console. Selected Period Fields not Displaying. The default selection is to display Baseline and Period 1. If you add other period fields but\nthen want to return to the default setting and find that the Console is not displaying your selection, clear your browser cache. (APP-1601)\nManage Reference Documents. This task enables you to associate a document with a Building Use, Property Type, and Furniture Standard. However, there is\ncurrently no way to view documents added for these items. It also enables you to associate a document with projects of different types. Currently, you are able to\nview documents for only projects that have the Scenario type. You are, however, able to view documents added for work request Problem Types, PM\nprocedures, and action items that are associated with a Proposed project. (3050281)\nAsset Portal known limitations\nView Equipment Plan. If you have a lot of asset symbols on the floor plan, they may not display the Equipment Code as asset text and may not be correctly\nfilled with color. (3028852)\nReal Property known limitations\nForecasting known limitations\n\nPortfolio Forecasting Wizard. Calculations. If the user units are different from the project units, when you calculate the area on the floor for an allocation event\nby multiplying headcount by average area per employee, the result can be off by a factor of 10.76. (3052105)\nStrategic Financial Analysis known limitations\nFinancial Analysis Console. VPA. The console does not load if the user has a VPA that is not compatible with the console restriction. Please see Adding VPA to\nthe Financial Analysis Console \u00a0for details on creating a VPA for this console. (3053673)\nSustainability &\u00a0Risk known limitations\nCompliance known limitations\nExtended Questionnaires. Service Requests from Mobile. Although the ability to create service requests from questionnaires was added to the Compliance\nSurveys mobile app, it has not yet been implemented in the Web Central Compliance application. Therefore, if a mobile questionnaire respondent provides\ndetails for a follow-up Service Request actions for any question in a questionnaire, then the respondent should take care to fully submit the questionnaire via the\nmobile app; they should not edit or submit via the Web Central questionnaire edit form because the Web Central edit form might not preserve the request details\nor set the status of the request as expected via the mobile app. (APP-4250)\nExtended Questionnaires. Assigned to Events. View my Events Calendar. The \"View My Events Calendar\" task for Compliance Program Coordinators does\nnot provide a link from events details to answer or review any questionnaires that might be attached to assigned events. The workaround is for Program\nCoordinators to use one of the other \"My... Events\" tasks to access assigned questionnaires. (APP-1667)\nExtended Questionnaires. Question Tree. Nodes without Child Records. In the Define Compliance Questionnaire view, when you examine a question that\nhas multiple choice answers, you will see that the Question Tree does not indicate that a node has no child content. When a node has no children, it still displays\nthe triangle-shaped icon for expanding and collapsing, giving the impression that there are child records. After you click the node, the triangle disappears until\nrefresh. (WC-2386)\nContracts and Compliance Programs with Cost Records. Deleting. You must first delete all assigned cost records associated with a contract or program or\nrequirement or term before you can delete the coordinating record. (APP-2276)\nHazard Abatement known limitations\nHomogeneous Areas not Highlighted. The application does not currently highlight all rooms identified as containing portions of homogeneous areas when\nthere are no assessments directly associated with those rooms. (APP-5240)\nWaste known limitations\nHazardous Waste Accumulation Report. The application stores and displays the hazardous waste accumulation volume limit application parameter value in\nunits of US Gallons. Users must take care to convert any other volume limit parameter into gallons if they adjust the application parameter controlling this. In any\ncase, the application does automatically and correctly convert the accumulated waste quantity to compare against this standard, no matter what units the waste\nhad been recorded in. (APP-5470)\nWaste Container Labels. The application generates formatted label documents for selected waste records. The web pop-up dialogue that shows the results of\nthe document creation has a bug limiting the display of outputted documents to 4 records. However, the application does still produce label documents for all the\nselected records as distinct files, named according to the waste record id number and saved to the .../WebCentral/schema/per-site/pdf-forms/[username] folder.\n(APP-5241)\nEnergy\u00a0known limitations\nProrating bills. Duplicate Bills. If you happen to enter duplicate bills for the same building and vendor with overlapping dates of service, and then attempt to\nauto-generate prorated bills, the application may encounter a duplicate primary key error when trying to generate one or more of the bill records. This is because\nthe resulting time periods will be the same, and the proration action will fail. (APP-5242, AD-924)\nConfigure Bill Processing. Excluded Bill Types. Archived Bills. The Configure Bill Processing view allows users to choose to exclude certain bill types from\nthe application's rules requiring bills to be archived in contiguous, ordered, monthly series. However, if an unusual situation occurs wherein a vendor account's\nutility bill type should change after some bills have already been archived, then the application will ignore a request to exclude the new bill type for new incoming\nbills for that vendor account. A work-around is to exclude both the old and new utility bill types from the monthly bill test. (APP-1855)\nProcess BAS Data View. The Web Central core does not yet support grid indexes on dates fields or on calculated fields. For example, if you create an index on\na date field having the value 2014-01-01, the value first shows as \u20182 \u2013 All.\u2019 If you click the \u20182\u2019 option, the value changes to \u201820\u2019; click the \u201820\u2019 and it's transformed to\n\u2018201\u2019; click the \u2018201\u2019 and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2019; click again, and it\u2019s transformed to \u20182014\u2026.\u2019 This issue appears in the right \u201cClean num\u201d panel in Energy\nManagement's Process BAS Data view. (WC-3108)\nView Prorated and Aggregated Bills. In rare cases, when the sum of aggregated bills exceeds a value 1000000 in the chosen display units, the application will\npresent an alert message stating that the value of the calculated field exceeds the field's maximum. In this view, the user may safely dismiss this message and\nproceed to view the bill record. (APP-5270)\nGreen Building known limitations\nFuel Density. Tree Panel. The Green Building / Background Data - Carbon footprint / Fuel Density task has a tree panel that manages two different levels of\ninformation. The tree panel does not display the second level. As a workaround, you can enter data so that both levels are shown, and then remove the data. (AD-\n1618)\nExport Energy Star Data. This report generates an xls report instead of xlsx format. Customers using it can re enable the xls file in the configuration. (AD-10362)\nCapital Projects known limitations\nProjects known limitations\nProjects. Importing from Microsoft Project. From the Projects / Execute / Procure task / Import tab you can import an *.xml file from Microsoft Project.\nDepending on your version of Microsoft Project, you may need to choose to \u201cOpen as a new project.\" Otherwise, you may encounter errors with the\npredecessors values if you decide to append the data or merge the data. (3011985)\nProject Template. VPA. With VPA active, if you use the Projects / Set Up / Define Template Projects task to create a new project and enter a Project Type and\nTitle, you will find that the process fails and a template project is not created. As a work-around, add NULL to the Site VPA list; this allows a Project record to be\ngenerated. (AD-8105)\nArchibus\u00a0Extension for Lease Accounting known limitations\nThe following limitations will be corrected in a future release or update.\nLease Classification Wizard. Amortization Schedule not Updated. If you change the recurrence period of a lease from monthly to yearly after working\nthrough the Step 1 and Step 2 tabs and before approving, the amortization schedule does not reflect the period change. As a workaround, you can use the\nBasicRules_ClearLeaseClassification.java rule to clear the classification, and then re-classify the lease.(APP-3701)\nLease Classification Wizard. Remaining Life Question. If you change your response to the question \u201cDoes lease term exceed 75% asset\u2019s remaining life?\u201d\nfrom Yes to No, the Wizard does not update the Lease Classification to \"Operating\" until you restart the Wizard. (APP-3795)\nLease Classification Wizard. Fair Market Value Field. If you change the Fair Market Value field in Step 2 to a value that would result in changing the Lease\nClassification to \"Operating,\" the Wizard does not update the classification to Operating until after you restart the Wizard. (APP-3808)\nLease Classification Wizard. Short-term Leases. Short-term leases and leases beneath the capitalization threshold currently are not classified with the\nFASB/IASB Classification status of Executory Contracts. As such they end up with amortization records and there is no option to approve them. (APP-3802)\nLease Classification Wizard. Information Buttons. Some of the Wizard's \"i\" buttons (such as Residual Value, Rate Implicit in Lease, and Depreciation Period)\nare missing explanations. (APP-3402)\nGenerate Subledger Entries for Leases.

(APP-3796)\nConnectors known limitations\nReserved Words. Archibus does not support field names with reserved words. For example, adding the field \"alter\" to the table bl, causes the Archibus\napplication server to fail to start when attempting to restart it. Therefore, the INBOUND use case of importing data into an Archibus table that has a field named\nwith a reserved word is not supported. The OUTBOUND use case of exporting data to a remote system like BUILDER SMS that has a database field that uses a\nreserved word (ex. order) is supported. (APP-3975)(APP-4769)\nEDI Example. The example file provided for the EDI connector in the HQ project demonstrates Web Central\u2019s ability to process EDI data formats, but only\naddresses the bill table. Since the example lacks a bill_lines connector definition and a bill connector association, it is not possible to fully load a complete utility\nbill using the EDI connector example. In the future, we plan to make a new example that is more realistic available for download. (3047882)\nBackslash Character. In some environments entering \\\\ in connector field parameters or connector parameters may result in the \\\\ being saved as \\.

Sections measured in pieces with quantity higher than 1 will not be split into multiple pieces of equipment when imported into\nArchibus. When transferring sections from BUILDERTM SMS measured in pieces and that have a quantity larger than one, Archibus does not create multiple\npieces of equipment. It creates only one piece of equipment with the corresponding value for the quantity attribute. (APP-2138)\nOutbound Connectors. Organizations and Sites. For new organizations and new sites transferred from Archibus to BUILDERTM SMS, the OUTBOUND\nconnectors do not set values to these BUILDERTM SMS fields:\nOrganization.UpdateCosts\nOrganization.UpdateCurves\nOrganization.ORG_ACF\nOrganization.ORG_SEISMICZONE\nOrganization.ORG_CI\nOrganization.ORG_FI\nOrganization.ORG_PI\nOrganization.ORG_FCI\nBUILDERTM SMS displays new organizations as new sites transferred from Archibus to BUILDERTM SMS, even without setting values to the above fields.\nBUILDERTM SMS users can enter the values for these fields using the BUILDERTM SMS interface. Running the OUTBOUND master connector a second time\nwill not affect the values entered by BUILDERTM SMS users for these fields. (APP-3215)\nArchibus V.2024.04\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Eptura, Inc.

In order to streamline the online help, a series of pre-24.1 topics describing legacy tasks for processing move orders has been removed\nfrom the online help. If you are using the legacy tasks and require documentation, see the V2022.01 topic:\nhttps://help.archibus.com/user_en_v2022.01/archibus.htm#../Subsystems/webc/Content/web_user/moves/concepts/legacy_tasks.htm (AD-10207)\nChanges in Web Central\nWebSphere and WebLogic. Beginning with V.26.2, WebSphere and WebLogic are not supported for new customers. For existing customers, WebLogic was\ntested and is compatible with V.26.3, and WebSphere was tested and is compatible with V.26.2. (AD-4875, AD-5705)\nReports Central.Charts. If you create a report that has a chart, and has a filter on a field that is not displayed in the chart (and therefore is not part of the chart\ndatasource), the chart now correctly updates against the filter. (AD-5927)\nReports Central. Charts. Deleting. You can now remove a chart from a saved report, as well as a report in progress. (AD-5641)\nDocument Management for Drawings. When editing WEB-INF\\config\\context\\remoting\\webservices-smartclient\\webservices.xml to set up Web Central to use\nan FTP server to access drawings, you no longer need to reverse the user name and password entries so that the username entry contains the password and\nthe password entry contains the user name. This issue did not impact SFTP or FTPS. (AD-7814)\nChanges in Smart Client Extension for AutoCAD\nSupported Versions of AutoCAD. AutoCAD 2023 is supported. AutoCAD 2015, 2016, and 2017 are no longer supported.\nLine weights are now supported in publishing enterprise graphics. (AD-8566)\n\nSimple line types are now supported in publishing enterprise graphics. (AD-8565)\nPublishing Enterprise Graphics. Graphics were sometimes offset in the published enterprise graphics that are displayed in the Space Console\u2019s PDF and\nDOCX formats. This is now fixed. (AD-8353)\nXREF. Some text contained in XREF files were offset in the Space Console\u2019s PDF and DOCX formats. This is now fixed. (AD-8415)\nChanges in Smart Client Extension for Revit\nSupported Versions of Revit. Revit 2023 is supported. Revit 2015, 2016, and 2017 are no longer supported.\nBIM Explorer. Can be refreshed by right clicking on the BIM Explorer tree view and then clicking on the \u2018Reload ADT\u2019 command. (AD-8443)\nPublish to Forge (Publish 3D). Publish to Forge from Revit is for trial purposes only. Enhanced support will be included with upcoming releases.. (AD-6971)\nMap Database Fields was not backwards compatible with pre 26.2 versions of the Web Central application. This is now fixed. (AD-8370)\nMap Database Fields. Some controls Map Database Fields form were chopped on hi-res monitors. This is now fixed. (AD-8392)\nCatalog. Certain conditions would display a \u2018Duplicate Key\u2019 error when selecting a category from the Catalog form. This is now fixed. (AD-9008)\nChanges in Mobile Client and Mobile Apps\nMaintenance. The problem with not being able to create more than 25 work logs (WRCF records) for a single work request has been resolved. (AD-8706)\nMaintenance. Fixed several smaller UI issues for work requests and checklists.\nCompliance Surveys. Fixed a scrolling issue that was preventing some users to complete their questionnaires. (AD-8688)\nAssessments. Fixed several issues with questionnaires that were causing questions not to be displayed, or to be incorrectly displayed with the wrong\nassessment item so that the user could not complete the assessment. (AD-8540, AD-9222, AD-9221)\nAsset and Equipment Survey app. Cannot see task details after editing. If you select a survey, edit a task, and then navigate back, you will no longer find\nthat the screen is empty. (AD-7272).\nChanges in OnSite Mobile App\nProblem Type. In the Create Work Request form, the x icon in the Problem Type field now clears the value in the field. (ON-732)\nNon-image Documents. When the work request has non-image document added from Maintenance Console, the All Activity area no longer shows records with\na blank body. (ON-624)\nURL Documents. If you enter a URL document in the Maintenance Console/Documents and Activity/Edit Document or Web Link form, OnSite now shows the\nURL in the Documents & Photos section of the Work Request Details page. (ON-623)\nVirtual Private Archibus (VPA). Users with VPA with settings can now sign in to OnSite. (ON-572)\nAssign Equipment Actions. The app now follows the proper behavior for when Can Change Work Request? field is set Yes so that only appropriate users can\nassign, edit, or clear equipment on the Work Request details page; previously, any craftsperson could do this because the program ignored Can Change Work\nRequest? setting. (ON-570)\nWork Requests without Work Orders. The following issue has been resolved. The correct behavior is: the app checks SLA after users enter all required\nrequest information and click the \u2018Next\u2019 button. If the SLA is not auto-approved or not auto work order, the \u201cSelf- assign\u201d action is disabled.\nOriginal issue: When the application parameter WorkRequestsOnly = 0, (that is, the system should not automatically assign work requests to work orders in the\nbackground) but the SLA is not set to \"Auto Work Order\", the technician can still create the work request, add a work log, and complete the request. However,\nthe supervisor will encounter an error when trying to close it. OnSite should not allow creating work requests for this case; instead, it should present a message\nsaying the corresponding SLA does match with the WorkRequestOnly=0 setting. (ON-483)\nChanges in Database\nSee also Database Schema Revision History (System Management Help)\nChanges in Workplace\nAccessibility Mode. In Accessibility Mode and with a screen reader active, it is now possible to select Start/End Date on the Calendar view when using\nkeyboard actions .(AD-6101).\nMaintenance requests. No Matching SLA. Workplace now matches the Maintenance Console's behavior of reporting a problem for which If there is no\nmatching SLA; if there is no matching SLA, you receive a message informing you that a work request cannot be created. Previously, Workplace created a work\nrequest in situations where there was no matching SLA. (AD-7472)\nDesk Bookings\nAvailable Desks. Highlight. If the floor plan is highlighted with available desks to book, switching to List view (by using the bottom right of the floor plan) and\nback no longer removes the Available Spaces highlight from the floor plan. (AD-8052)\nAvailable Desks. Messages. We have improved the messages that the user receives when no desks are available to book. This occurs when all hotelable seats\nhave been booked, or when EnforceFloorCapacityTarget is set to \"Yes\" and the floor has reached its maximum occupancy target. (AD-8097)\nBook Button. It is no longer possible to press the BOOK button several times when making a booking and thereby create multiples bookings. (AD-8122)\nBooking to be Near a Colleague. When you search for a room that is near a room booked by a colleague, you will no longer find that the marker for the\ncolleague obscures the room on the floor plan that you wish to book. (AD-8056)\nRecommended Seats. Dismiss Message. We have improved the user interface and messaging for dismissing the recommended seat feature. (AD-7620)\nFloor List. Previously, if a floor had no available seats, the Workspace Booking screen did not include the floor in the list of floors for the building. Based on user\nfeedback, the Workspace Booking screen now includes these floors in the floor list; this enables the user to load the floor plan if desired. A counter next to each\nfloor lists the number of available seats on the floor; for floors at full capacity, no counter is listed. (AD-6195)\nAllowMultipleBookings. Two problems when AllowMultipleBookings is set to No are resolved. You could not create a booking for \"Myself\" after booking a\nroom for a visitor. Also, multiple bookings (even for the same seat) can no longer be created using the \u201cRecommendation\u201d dialog. (AD-8970, AD-8961)\nMeeting Room Reservations\nRoom Type and Room Category Fields. If you have not completed the Room Type and Room Category fields for a reservable room, you will no longer\nencounter problems when trying to reserve the room. (AD-8230)\nVPA. The ApplyVpaRestrictions=false parameter now applies when creating a new reservation in Workplace.(AD-6935)\nChanges in Space\nSpace and Portfolio Planning Console. When there is no available area on a floor and the user has opted to hide unavailable areas, the stack plan now\ncorrectly hides the floor. Previously, the stack plan was displaying the floor with unavailable area. This resulted in the data points on the right not lining up with\ntheir representations in the stack plan. (AD-8152)\nSpace Console\nWe enhanced the tree behavior to sustain the state of tree nodes after the commit. (AD-8604)\nYou can now export social distancing circles. (AD-4221)\nIf you promote a validated field to the Rooms table, the highlight will now use the corresponding highlight color defined for the validated field. Previously,\nthe highlight indicated only whether or not the promoted field had a value. (AD-7365)\nWhen you filter and then export toi XLS, the resulting spreadsheet's data is no longer obscured by a message stating a \"restriction is in effect.\" (AD-7872)\n\nChanges in Real Property\nLease Console. Multi-Tab View. Previously, in the multi-tab view, when users scroll down within a tab to see all of the records the Control bar would disappear\nand users would need to scroll up to make it reappear. Likewise, a tab may display empty space where it had room to display additional records. These issues\nhave been corrected. (AD-8659, AD-8658)\nTenants Leases by Building. When you generate a paginated report, the view now correctly shows leases for which you are the tenant. Previously, the\ngenerated paginated report generated included all leases by building. (AD-2332)\nChanges in Capital Projects\nManage Condition Assessment Items. Create Service Request. This view has two changes pertaining to the Create Service Request command. The icon for\n\"Create Service Request\" is now labeled \"Report Problem.\" Secondly, this view was previously checking for a license for the Service Desk application and not\npresenting the Create Service Request icon if the user did not have a license for Service Desk. The view no longer checks for the Service Desk license. (AD-8381)\nManage Condition Assessment Items. Open in a New Tab.From the Navigator, if you selected the Projects / Condition Assessment / Assessment Manager /\nManage Condition Assessment Items view and optrd to load it in a new tab, you would receive an error message. This has been resolved. (AD-3026)\nChanges in Sustainability &\u00a0Risk\nFlash Charts. The following Sustainability &\u00a0Risk reports were using the Flash Chart control. They have been updated to use HTML charts. ab-energy-bill-\nprorate-column.axvw, ab-energy-bill-prorate-pie.axvw, ab-energy-bill-prorate.axvw, ab-energy-measure-and-verify.axvw, ab-gb-cert-dash.axvw, ab-gb-dash-cert-\nprj-compare-tabs.axvw, ab-gb-dash-cert-prj-compare.axvw, ab-gb-fp-dash.axvw, and ab-waste-rpt-amounts-by-cat1.axvw. (AD-8928)\nDefine Utility Rates. A problem with an incorrect cost_unit when the user locale is not English has been corrected. (AD-7738)\nChanges in Maintenance\nMaintenance Console. Completed Work. The Maintenance Console no longer displays completed work in the craftsperson's queue in the case that the work\nrequest has pending checklists and multiple craftspersons assigned; it is now removed from a craftsperson's queue when the craftsperson completes their work.\n(AD-8276)\nMaintenance Console. Per-Row Actions. In V2022.01, we removed the per-row action buttons for a work request. We have added this feature back by adding\nto each row an ellipses button that presents the appropriate actions. (AD-8193)\nCosts of Completed Work Requests. Totals in Wrong Cells. In the Costs of Completed Work Requests view (ab-ondemand-report-cost-tabs.axvw), the\nAccounts tab no longer presents totals in the wrong cells. (AD-7334)\nSearch and Manage view. Now shows resources for archived Work Requests. (AD-8272)\nChanges in Assets\nEquipment Systems Console\nRemoved incorrect reference to the 360 Viewer. (AD-8847)\nAllow selecting equipment on the drawing viewer for floor plans published from Revit. (AD-5963)\nAsset Disposal Console. Enable Reports button in the \u201cEvaluate Asset for Disposal\u201d tab. (AD-7824)\nAsset Registration Console. Fixed generating floor plan PDF issues for the Asset Relationship Assignment tab. (AD-8062)\nAsset Lifecycle Console. On the Asset Registry tab, fixed showing duplicated asset records, caused by specific licensing check. (AD-7529)\nFoundations. If you sign in as a Foundations user (sample user AFM-FDN), you can now define and edit equipment standards using the new task \u201cDefine\nEquipment Standards.\u201d This is available under the \u201cBackground Data & Reports\u201d process. (AD-8251)\nChanges in Workplace Services\nHoteling\nDefine Amenities for Hotelable Rooms (ab-ht-rm-amenities.axvw) is now available as a task in the Reservations SaaS module. This view is used for defining\nfixed resources (amenities) to hotelable rooms. (AD-8786)\nReservations\nOutlook Plugin disabled. We have corrected a problem with Outlook disabling the Outlook Plugin because of a shutdown delay. (AD-9041)\nOutlook Plugin. We have corrected a problem with the Outlook Plugin log being written to %appdata%\\ARCHIBUS\\(null)\\OutlookPlugin; the version number is\nnow correctly included instead of \"(null)\". (AD-8640)\nFrom Address. Meetings with multiple attendees were being sent with the wrong \"From\" address, causing errors. This was an issue only in non-Exchange\nenvironments. (AD-8602)\nReservations Calendar Console. Employee field. Automatic Lookup. If you add the automatic lookup feature to the em.name field, you can now reserve\nmeeting rooms using the Reservations Calendar Console or Workplace. (AD-7767)\nReservations Calendar Console. Calendar preview. The preview for reserved blocks no longer continues beyond when the Reservations would actually end.\nThis was a display issue occurring before booking. Once the reservation was made, the correct dates were saved. (AD-5331)\nReservations Calendar Console. Approval notifications. If the approval time expires, Archibus now correctly sends out notifications on time under these\nconditions: a room arrangement require an approval, the Action if Approval Time Expires option is set to Notify, and you specify a user to receive this notification.\nPreviously, notifications were not sent out to this user until after the reservation was supposed to take place. (AD-6720)\nReservations Calendar Console. Editing meetings. The following issue is resolved: Create a new meeting and select a room that has other scheduled\nmeetings during the current week. Next, in the My Reservations tab, locate this meeting to edit it. The Calendar Console shows the reserved room in the room\nlist, and the edited meeting is shown in red in the calendar. However, you might also need to see the other existing meetings in case that you want to change the\ntimes; the Calendar Console does not show these other existing meetings. (APP-6518) (AD-5827)\nArchibus\u00a0Help known limitations\nNon-English help from the Navigator. If you use the right-click Help command on a Navigator process, you will receive an error message that the topic cannot\nbe found. This is because the localized version of Archibus Help does not contain topics at this level of detail. In a future release, the right-click Help command\nwill load the appropriate topic from the English version of Archibus Help. (AD-2786)\nArchibus SaaS known limitations\nSAML SSO . Customers using SAML SSO using Shibboleth SP and request-header Spring security config, who also wish to use REST APIs and/or the OnSite\nmobile app, will need to provision a second instance of WebCentral to support REST APIs, as the request-header Spring security config breaks JWT token\nauthentication\nUser AFM-MOD. Navigator missing some Risk applications. When you sign in as sample user AFM-MOD, you should access all applications licensed for\nSaaS. However, the Emergency Preparedness, Sustainability Assessment, Health & Safety, Hazard Abatement, Hazardous Materials, Waste, and Green\nBuilding modules are missing from the Navigator. If you need to see these modules when signed in as AFM-MOD, you can assign them and unassign some\nothers. In the future, the Navigator will be able to display all modules assigned to AFM-MOD at one time. (AD-6967)\nHome Page Publishing. SaaS Partner Administrator. If you sign in as a SaaS Partner Administrator (such as sample user AFM-BP), run the System / SaaS\nPartner Administrator / Manage Home Pages and Processes task, modify a home page, and publish your changes; you receive an error message. As a\nworkaround: use System / Add-In Manager / Publish Home Pages by Role to publish home pages after modifying them. (APP-6426)\nMobile Framework known limitations\n\nFail to log in again when reloading mobile client. iOS. If you log in, close mobile client, and then attempt to log in again, you will find that you cannot log in.\nThe failure stems from being already logged into the OIDC connector and trying to reestablish a session. IOS has not been fully upgraded for service workers\ndue to extra restrictions service workers have in IOS Safari. Therefore IOS still requires the connection checks.A workaround is to wait until the OIDC session is\ninvalid/logged out, as well as not selecting \"remember me\" (for example in Okta) while on IOS. Not closing the app while there is a valid session will avoid this\nissue entirely. This is not an issue for Android. (AD-6517)\nSurveys. Measurement questions. Android. With the survey (questionnaire) features in both Maintenance and Compliance Surveys mobile apps, users can\nenter non-numeric values for Measurement questions. These values do not correctly upload when the mobile apps are synced. A future version will add\nvalidation so that users can input only numbers as the answer of Measurement type questions. (AD-4600)\nWeb Central known limitations\nBIM\u00a0Viewer. Sample Data. In the sample HQ\u00a0project, building HQ loads as a floor plan instead of a model. This occurs because in our Forge account, we have a\nCAD drawing that is linked to building HQ. This will be corrected in the future. (AD-9585)\nDocument fields. If you check in documents that have uses spaces in their file names, Archibus will replace each space with the \"+\" character. You can avoid\nthis by renaming the documents before checking them in. (AD-9421)\nReport Central. Charts. In order to see more of the chart, you might attempt to resize the grid panel and find that you cannot resize it. In this case, you can hide\nthe filter, and then scroll the region to see the entire chart (AD-9149)\nAutomatic Lookup. We are investigating inconsistent behavior when automatic lookup is enabled. (AD-8345, AD-8348),\nImages. Firefox. When images have a larger vertical size than horizontal size (a portrait image), they may appear distorted on Firefox. This is not an issue for\nother Web browsers. (AD-7140)\nSelect Values. Floors. For view 2.0 views that have a filter that includes the Floor Code field, the view may not show all available floors. The root cause is that\nthe core UI grid control determines the number of pages based on the number of index records. For the Floor selector, the index uses the Building Code, i.e.\nthere are 111 buildings with floors. Thus, the grid shows only two pages of floor records (one page = 100 records). (AD-3706)\nMenu options hidden. When a view title is too long, the top menu actions (User Menu, User Help, Add to Favorites) and client logo are not visible. (AD-4820)\nNavigator. Non-English Locale. If you launch Web Central from the Smart Client and are using a non-English locale, the Web Central Navigator will not display\nyour applications and tasks. (AD-3866)\nPolish characters in V.25.x user interface. With the V.25.1 user interface refresh, special characters in UI titles translated to Polish do not appear like the other\ncharacters. For customers who have this issue, we recommend modifying all CSS files in the \\schema\\ab-core\\views\\navigator folder to replace this line: (AD-\n2292)\nfont-family: \"Open Sans\";\nwith this line:\nfont-family: \"Open Sans\", Arial;\nQuestionnaires. Non-English. Questionnaires, such as those in Condition Assessment and Sustainability Assessment, do not allow assessors to edit out-of-\nthe-box, sample questions that have been localized from English (US) to other languages. The workaround is for Archibus Administrators to use Archibus Smart\nClient to edit the text of these sample questions. This issue affects only sample data questionnaires that have been localized from English. (AD-1547)\nExtended Questionnaires. Document/Photo. The Web Central questionnaire form (for both Compliance and Maintenance) does not currently support\nrespondent-initiated submission of more than one document/photo attachment per question, whether or not the questionnaire designer specifies a value greater\nthan 1 for Maximum Number Responses. The mobile app does support this feature. You cannot delete the uploaded document after Save the question-answer;\nthere is no action when clicking the X button. A questionnaire designer should take this into account when designing forms. (APP-2426, AD-4431)\nIf the intended respondents will be using Web Central to submit documents and flexibility in number of document responses is desired, then the designer\ncan work around the limitation by defining a parent question containing a follow-up question of type document and allow multiple instances of the parent\nquestion.\nFor example, parent question could be multiple choice \"attach a document?\" Yes/No. If Yes, then the application shows the document question as a\nfollow-up. Set up the \"Attach a document\" question to allow multiple answers, such that the respondent can add another, answer \"Yes\" and so on.\nExtended Questionnaires. Error Message for Mixed Section. Adding one single choice question to the Mixed Section using the \"...\" button of this section and\nthen adding a Date question by using the \"Add Question\" button (at the top of the tab) presents an error message. As a workaround, add the Date question using\nthe \u2018\u2026' button of the mixed section, rather than the Add Question button. (AD-4868)\nHome Page Editor. Maps. When creating home pages, you add only one map bucket to each home page. (WC-2790)\nHome Pages. Localized. For some international users, home pages may display English titles for columns in the Metric Trends panel. If this issue occurs, the\nuser can switch to a different home page and go back, or sign out and sign in again. (WC-2373)\nGrid. Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) fields. If working with a view in which you define highlight patterns (such as Space / Space Inventory / Background\nData / Define Division and Department Highlight Patterns, ab-sp-create-dp-hatch.axvw), and you set a gradient highlight, create a swatch bitmap, and refresh the\nview, the Highlight ACAD\u00a0Pattern (Swatch) field will not correctly show the swatch bitmap for the gradient highlight. Instead, the fields show the same color for all\ngradient highlight definitions. (WC-2748)\nGrid 3.0. Grid Control 3.0, which is used in views such as PM Planner (ab-pm-planner.axvw) and Service Console (ab-request-console.axvw), presents an error\nif you try to sort by a field that is not from the main table. (AD-8474)\nSchema Change Wizard. Oracle. When using Schema Change Wizard on an Oracle database, you may face the error ORA-01031: insufficient privileges when\nchoosing to re-create any of the Archibus security tables: afm_users; afm_groups. Resolution: Choose \"Alter existing table structures (preserves additional\nfields)\" option when trying to update afm_users/afm_groups tables. (3045736)\nSmart Client known limitations\nConfigure Application Parameters for CAD and BIM. From Smart Client, the \"Configure Application Parameters for CAD and BIM\" task is not set to load as\nWeb Central view. You can correct this by using the Database Update Wizard to run a script in the /webapp/projects/users/public/dt/v2022.02.003, which sets the\nTask Type to \"WEB URL.\" (AD-9381)\nNavigator. With a non-SaaS license, logging in to the Smart Client as AFM incorrectly produces a Navigator that includes an Archibus SaaS process. (AD-3794)\nSAML. Connecting to SAML requires user to make server selection on subsequent sign-ins. (AD-1996)\nCertificate Authentication. Web Central tasks. Cannot data transfer or launch Web Central if Certificate Authentication is in effect. (SMAR-626)\nEditing standards tables. If you edit Furniture Standards or Equipment Standards with the default database, the titles for the Length and Width fields will show\nincorrectly as \"ft\" or \"M\". If you log in with a different locale (e.g. view an Imperial project as a Metric user) the program will convert the values. The condition also\noccurs in Furniture or Equipment Standards views loaded in Web Central. To avoid this condition in both environments, load the Archibus Fields table (afm_flds),\nfind the Length and Width fields, and change their Numeric Format from \"Length\" to \"Default\". (3037311)\nDeleting a record with a date/time field as part of its primary key. You are unable to delete records from tables that have a date/time field as part of the\nprimary key, such as the ehs_medical_mon_results table. There are no such errors when deleting records from the same table in Web Central views. (WC-2169)\nDeleting. hwr and hwo tables. It is not possible to delete records from Smart Client grid views that present these tables. As a work-around, delete the records\nfrom Web Central.(SMAR-596)\nDeleting. Bulk Editing. Currently there is no way of bulk deleting data from Smart Client. If you select all records and then hit Delete, only those records\ncurrently displayed on screen are deleted; all of the other records that are selected but not on screen remain. As a work-around, in View Definition Wizard, create\na single panel interactive report for the table in question, choose only the primary key field(s) unless you need to add a restriction. In the preview pane, enable\nadvanced editing, and add multipleSelectionEnabled=\u201dtrue\u201d in the panel, then insert a panel action with a command type deleteSeletedRows.\nSave Changes and preview the view and you can check all and delete right from the preview, without needing to save/publish it. (SMAR-17)\nRibbon. The Smart Client ribbon is very small on high resolution monitors. (SMAR-503)\nGrid. Refresh when filtering. After you set and clear a filter, the grid does not correctly update record counts and refresh. As a workaround, run the Clear action\non the menu ribbon. (SMAR-609)\n\nReplace Column. When there are more than two tables in the standard role attached to the Smart Client grid view, the command presents errors. (SMAR-528)\nModified views cannot be saved as default view. Log in as a user that has the Security group SYS-VIEW-ALTER (such as AFMX), open a view, change the\nview, save, and make it the default view. Reload, and the default view will not reflect your changes. (SMAR-329)\nExplorer pane. Recent Views list. When you create new views and save them in the Explorer's list of recent views, you can save up to 8 views. When you save\nthe ninth view, the system removes the newest view from the list. It should remove the oldest view from the list. (SMAR-907)\nData Transfer. Dates deleted from the output file are not cleared in the database after transferring in the file with the changes made. (SMAR-671)\nSmart Client Extension for AutoCAD\u00a0known limitations\nInsert Asset. The Insert Asset logic doesn\u2019t take into account the AssetTypeDetail.ParameterUnits value when inserting the asset. Therefore, in a\ndrawing with Imperial/Architectural units, running the Insert Asset command on the RM layer inserts the asset in inches rather than feet.(AD-7470)\nQuery Table. The Query Table command does not include fields that contribute to the primary key; for example, it does not show the Building Code and Floor\nCode values for rooms. (SMAR- 798)\nHighlighting commands\nUnclosed polylines. If some areas don't highlight with solid highlights, they might be open not closed polylines. If so, close them. The AutoCAD solids\ndon't fill unclosed-closed polylines. AutoCAD hatch patterns do, however. Notice that if you have multiple areas of one type (e.g. Office standard), having\none unclosed polyline may cause others to also not have a solid fill (since Archibus hatches many of them in one go for efficiency's sake). (3030818)\nHatch patterns. The Archibus-defined patterns (from the .pat file) are not being loaded into AutoCAD at the time of highlighting. Only the out-of-the-box\nAutoCAD patterns work as expected because the highlighting logic defaults to a SOLID hatch pattern if it can't find the pattern definition. (SMAR-902)\nLarge floor plans. When dealing with very large floor plans (3,500 rooms on a single floor), commands like Catalog Layer and Highlight by Department do not\ngive progress feedback, but function correctly.\nAsset Text Height. The Smart Client Extension ignores the atxt_ht_in and atxt_ht_cm in favor of the atxt_ht value, which is in inches. For metric drawings the\nSCE converts this to cm. (SMAR-189)\nEdit Data. Suite areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0.\nIf you press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nTrial layers. Asset text. Asset text is left-justified instead of center-justified. (SMAR-492)\nExplorer window. Anchoring. When you open a drawing from within the Smart Client drawings list, the Explorer window should be positioned according to the\nsettings made in the previous session; instead, it opens in the floating position and you must reset it.(SMAR-702)\nDrawing Publishing\u00a0\nAutoCAD Leader objects. EMF does not support arrows or text with the leaders. SVG supports only solid arrows. (3044919)\nSecondary circulation areas as regions. As documented in\nhttps://www.archibus.net/ai/abizfiles/v23_help/archibus_help/user_en/archibus.htm#../Subsystems/webc/Content/web_user/space/concepts/open_plan.htm,\nyou can draw accurate polylines for secondary circulation using AutoCAD REGIONS. Publishing these drawings may result in rooms being set incorrectly\nin front of or behind other rooms. In order for rooms within a secondary circulation region to be shown and highlighted in front of the secondary circulation\nspace in a published drawing, they must be numbered higher than the secondary circulation space. (3051186)\nXREF The XREF Layer does not publish when the TURNOFFALL* value is specified in the additional layers field. As a workaround, turn off layers\nindividually and do not use the TURNOFFALL* feature to control XREF Layers.(SMAR-1001)\nAFM_NET_LISP \"Publish\" command. Ignores the viewWindow attribute when the publishType is EMF and the generated file is published to extents.\n(SMAR-737).\nSVG. Background Color. If you set the Set the ColorMapping field to BLACK for AbPubBackground in the sample HQ database and publish, the black\nbackground does not appear to take effect. This is because there are multiple active rules in the database, and later results overwrite the earlier ones. To\nresolve this either (a) set the Active flag to No for all of the SVG files except for one; or, (b) specify a unique Rule Suffix (e.g. -bl, -reg, -eq) for each rule,\nexcept for the one that has a Color Mapping value so that different rules will produce different output files. (SMAR-417)\nSVG. Hatches. Complex hatches, meaning that there are multiple polylines that are used as the boundaries for the hatch, do not publish to SVG; whereas\nhatches that do successfully publish are contained in a single polyline. You can separate the hatches using HATCHEDIT, and the publishing will work as\nexpected. (SMAR-513)\nRefreshing. Firefox. If your workstation uses Firefox and you load a drawing's enterprise graphics in Web Central or in the Smart Client, then republish\nthat drawing's enterprise graphics, the change may not appear when you reload the view with the enterprise graphics. For performance reasons, some\nversions of Firefox do not immediately refresh the enterprise graphics files from their local cache even when the file has a later time stamp, as checking\nthe time stamp involves an extra query to the server for each file. To view your changes, clear your cache or restart your browser. If you wish to see\nchanges immediately without clearing your cache, you can change your browser cache settings to control the problem.\n1. In Firefox's menu, select Tools >\u00a0Options.\n2. Select the Advanced tab, and then the Network tab.\n3. In the Offline Storage section, enter 0 for the MB of space used for the cache.(3024655)\nSmart Client Extension for Revit known limitations\nFile names with special characters. When you publish a Revit file whose file name contains spaces and characters such as #+\u00b0$(), you may receive an error\nmessage when viewing the SVG file in Web Central. (WC-3132)\nOpening a model. Error message. Due to the way that Updater classes are implemented, Revit presents a message that you are missing a third-party updater.\nYou can ignore this message. (SMAR-974).\nNumber.\nIf you Number a room and then use the Smart Client to show the Room field \"Perimeter ft\u201d, the perimeter shows as 0. If you Data Edit or Data Edit\nMultiple, the number is corrected. (SMAR-285)\nIf the database does not contain enough information for the Number command to execute, it fails to number instead of providing feedback to the user\nabout what database information is needed to successfully run the command. (SMAR-526)\nDeleting rooms. Revit does not notify Archibus when Revit deletes rooms. Currently, Archibus cannot uncatalog rooms on that event. Use the Synchronization /\nUncatalog Records without Assets command to clear the Drawing Name and Id fields on these rooms in one step.\nWeb Query. If the last primary key value for an asset is a single digit (e.g. if you query for room \"1\"), then the pop up dialog results are not restricted to that one\nrecord. This doesn't occur for two- and three-digit IDs (e.g. room \"10\" or \"100\"). (3035367, 3035366, 3034950, 3034414)\nPublish Enterprise Graphics. Colors. Since Revit floor plans do not have color, colors for Enterprise Graphics generated from Revit can cause confusion,\nespecially since the user does not have control over this. In a future release, Archibus will address this issue. (SMAR-988)\nEdit Data\u00a0\nRooms. Some objects in linked models are not correctly picking up room codes of the rooms they are inside of. (SMAR-785)\nGroup Areas. For new groups, the Group Code will show as \"1\" until the record is actually saved. Thereafter, the proper autonumbered ID will show.\n(3034828)\nSuite Areas. If you use Edit Data on suite areas, and if you use Select Values to select an existing suite, the area in the form shows temporarily as 0. If\nyou press OK, the correct area is recorded and appears correctly on subsequent invocations of the command. (3035340, 3034959)\nLong parameter values. If you have a parameter value (e.g. Name) mapped to an Archibus field (e.g. Option 1), and that parameter has an existing\nvalue longer than the field width in Archibus, then you will not be able to create a record using Edit Data. You can shorten the parameter value using the\nRevit Parameters dialog. Alternately, if you use the Archibus Catalog command, the command will find all of these conditions and allow you to rectify them\nindividually or in groups. (3034793)\nMap Database Fields. This form is empty if there are no assets in the model of the specified asset type. (3034357)\nCopy / Paste. If you copy and paste furniture and equipment, you also copy and paste their Revit properties. Use the Archibus synchronization commands to\nfind and resolve any duplicates. (3030989)\nSystem Administration known limitations\nSecurity. BIRT. BIRT 4.8.0 has security vulnerabilities with a Severity of High. For a secure environment, you can remove BIRT. For details, see\nhttps://help.archibus.com/system/sysman.htm#BIRT/BIRT_Overview.htm (AD-9575)\n\nSecurity. LDAP. The result of using a distinguished name with a comma results in this error in archibus.log: \"LDAP: error code 49 - Invalid Credentials\". The\nsolution is to change the bind user's \"CN=\" value to a name that does not contain a comma. (3037258)\nSecurity. SSO. In SSO mode, when the user name is incorrect, the user is redirected to the timeout page instead of the SSO error page. (WC-2027)\nICS and Time Zones. The ical4j jar is used to resolve timezone information. For example, it will try to open http://tzurl.org/zoneinfo/America/New_York which is a\nURL referenced by the America/New_York.ics file in the jar. The response to an HTTP request to this URL will be an HTTP 302 redirect to\nhttps://static.tzurl.org/zoneinfo/America/New_York.ics which is the actual file containing timezone information.\nWe\u2019ve observed some implementations of java.net.URLConnection to not redirect, causing this redirect message to be processed as timezone data. This\nmanifests as exceptions when trying to use or resolve a timezone.\nThe workaround is to disable the feature for updating timezone data and use the information in the jar. To do this, add a text file named ical4j.properties to the\nroot of the java classpath with the following content:\nnet.fortuna.ical4j.timezone.update.enabled=false (AD-9432)\nDatabase Update Wizard. Version-to-Version Database Update Scripts in SQL Format. When you generate sql for csv files, you may experience that the\nscripts do not properly separate statements.(AD-6177)\nSolution Templates. IofT. The Technologies / Innovative Solutions /Integrations - IoT / IoT Space Utilization solution template is not Oracle-compatible. (AD-8296)\nSolution Templates. Calendar Control. The Reservations Calendar example records multiple days for one-day events. (WC-3237)\nConnectListener. When ConnectListener runs, it does not move the previous afm_conn_log entries to afm_conn_logh. (AD-7003)\nSchema Change Wizard. The archibus.log fails to show correctly field and table name in the global dataset. This is only a logging issue. There is no functional\nerror. (3033565)\nBIRT\u00a0reports. Pie Charts and Bar Charts. You cannot load datasource reports with pie and bar charts inside of Web Central; meaning that you cannot use VPA\nor pooled database connections with BIRT and pie charts or bar charts. (WC-2321)\nGDPR. Workflow rules. Workflow rules for GDPR need to be activated by running the script \\dt\\24.1.004\\schema\\sysadmin\\gdpr\\update-schema.duw (DB-361)\n(DB-362) (DB-366)\nGDPR. Filter. Name and Email fields. Sybase. The System / Archibus Administrator - User and Security / GDPR Personal Information view displays a filter\nconsole containing the fields 'Name' and 'Email'. On a Sybase database, entering more than 125 characters in one of these two filter fields will result in an error.\nOn all other databases, these fields are set to accept up to 128 characters. (APP-4792)\nGrid. API. Grid panels can display custom values calculated in Java Script code. An example can be seen in the following view. This example displays the\ncustom Location field that is composed from Building, Floor, Room, and Location database fields. The example also includes a menu that allows the user to\nproduce reports with the grid data. Due to Web Central technical implementation limitation, custom values formatted in Java Script code cannot be displayed in\nthese reports.(3041685)\nPath: Technologies / User Interface Add-Ins / Assemblies with Multiple Panels / Find-Manage with Categories\nFile: ab-products\\solutions\\assemblies\\work-wizard\\ab-ex-work-wizard.js\nFunction: updateLocations()\nGrid. API. When designing views with a grid panel, you cannot set specific grid column width in pixels. The grid automatically sets column widths according to\nthe available space and the data displayed in each column. (3045398)\nGrid. API. The Clear Filter icon is not visible if the last grid column is hidden. To avoid the issue, add an empty last column. The condition does not affect any of\nthe Archibus applications. (3040363)\nAutomatic ID Lookup. Sample department data. Those wishing to convert the sample HQ department names to numeric codes to illustrate the use of this\nfeature should use the Basic Rule Wizard to execute this file: \\schema\\ab-products\\common\\resources\\basic-rules\\BasicRules_GenerateIds.java\nAutomatic ID Lookup. Pkey fields.If a System Administrator enables Automatic ID\u00a0Lookup (LookupID), then they should remove any primary key (Pkey) fields\nfrom the <translatable> section of afm_scmpref.preferences. Lookups do not work properly for translatable primary key fields. (APP-1500)\nDatabase known limitations\nDatabase Update Wizard. Script Calls Previous Version. The v2022.02.002 script calls the localization files from the v2022.01.001 folder. This affects the\nfollowing situation: if a new user purchases V2022.02, and if they want to develop their system based on schema database, and if they are using European\nlanguage, they will see the non-translated English strings of 2022.02. The fix is to correct the paths in \\dt\\v2022.02.002\\translation\\update-translation-template-\nsinglebyte.duw by replacing \u201cv2022.01.001\u201c with \u201cv2022.02.002\u201c, and then execute the duw script. (AD-9931)\nDatabase Update Wizard. Additional Script. A script in the /webapp/projects/users/public/dt/v2022.02.003 folder corrects the \"Configure Application\nParameters for CAD and BIM\" task in Smart Client to load as a Web Central view by setting the Task Type to \"WEB URL.\" This folder also contains a correction\nfor OnSite pertaining to closing work requests that were generated as a follow-up action to a checklist question. Database administrators can apply the scripts as\ndesired. (AD-9381, ON-971)\nv2022.01.001 scripts. If you attempt to run the V.2022.01.001 DUW update scripts twice, the import will fail. The issue is that the connector with connector ID\n\u201cconnect_dp_em\u201d was updated and then deleted in the v2022.01.001 script folder. The workaround is to create a connector with this ID before rerunning the\nscript. You can run the below statement in the Database Update Wizard\u2019s preview text box, or you can create the connector through the Configure Connectors\nview. As long as the record exists before the script is run, the script will not fail when it is run more than one time. (AD-8621)\ninsert into afm.afm_connector (connector_id) values ('connect_dp_em');\nOnSite mobile app known limitations\nVPA. If multiple craftspersons assigned to the same work request do not have the same VPA and if one craftsperson creates a work request from a checklist, the\nother craftsperson will not be able to access the work request. In future releases, we will improve the messaging regarding this situation. (ON-973)\nRequestor section. Message icon. Android. In some versions of Android phones, clicking on the message icon does not work and the message form does not\nopen. This is due to a bug in React Native, for which we opened a support case. (ON-525)\nNew requests. Cannot See. After you create a new request, you may not see it in the Request List because it is added to the end of the request list. You can\nuse the pull-to-refresh feature to re-sort the requests according to the \u201corder by\u201d option.(ON-487)\nWork Request List. Updating. Previous work request data persist in the cache and displays in the work request list. You must pull to refresh on My Work in\norder to get the updated requests. (ON-733) When you create a new request, it is added to the bottom of the list because the sort order of work requests is not\nupdating to reflect a new request. Pulling to refresh solves this issue.(ON-723)\nClosing a Work Requests Generated from a Checklist. If you have generate a new work request as an action for completing a checklist, you will encounter\nproblems when trying to close this work request. The /webapp/projects/users/public/dt/v2022.02.003 folder contains a correction for OnSite pertaining to closing\nwork requests that were generated as a follow-up action to a checklist question. Database administrators can apply the scripts as desired. (AD-9381, ON-971)\nMobile App known limitations\nCompliance Surveys. Syncing. If the auditor has a long list of survey tasks and syncs a complete survey, they might see that some incomplete survey tasks\ndisappear. As a workaround, reset the filter in the Survey Tasks view and sync the app again. (AD-7194)\nCompliance Surveys. Truncated Text. If the text for a Yes/No or Multiple Choice question is not displayed or is truncated on your mobile device, you can edit\nthe question and change the Display Format from 'Short' to 'Long'.(AD-6407)\nMaintenance. Resources. If you add resources, such as parts, tools, and costs, you will not see the new resource records in both Resource Details form. Thus,\nyou might think the resource records were not added. After syncing, you will see that the resource record were successfully added. (AD-5908)\nMaintenance. Checklists. Android 11. If you try to create a request from a work request's checklist, you receive a blank screen. This occurs only on Android 11.\n(AD-5863)\nMaintenance. Stopping Work. Supervisors cannot stop a work request that has a pending checklist. (AD-4883)\nMaintenance. Reopening a Checklist when Verifying It. If a supervisor reopens a checklist during the verify process, the work request correctly moves back to\nthe Issued status. If this work request's checklist is still pending and the supervisor or craftsperson now selects multiple work requests to complete (including this\n\none), you will find that you can complete this work request despite the fact that it has an open checklist. The issue does not occur when working from the My\nWork form because the form does not support multi-select action. (AD-4882)\nMaintenance. Confirmation. SLAs can contain Confirmation steps on the \"Issued\" and \"Completed\" statuses. Users who are assigned to these steps can\nperform the confirmation (Approve/Reject/Cancel) in the Maintenance Console, but this feature is not supported in the mobile Maintenance app. Confirmation\nsteps work only on the \"Requested\" and \"Assigned to Work Order\" statuses on mobile.(AD-7267)\nMaintenance. Sync Issues.\nWhen a user performs a Sync action on the mobile Maintenance app, any craftspersons hours data (such as Actual Hours or Overtime Hours) can be\noverwritten if those hours were entered in Web Central. (3045897)\nWhen a requestor reports multiple maintenance requests of the same type from different locations and then syncs to upload all the requests at once, the\nmobile app does not consistently upload all the requests. To avoid this problem, sync after entering each request. (3048805).\nPart quantities are synced on the mobile Maintenance app only when you sync the background data. This affects mobile users who perform any of the\nfollowing actions on the mobile maintenance application:\no Estimate parts on a work request\no Add purchased parts to inventory\no Complete a work request that includes parts\nAfter you perform any of these actions and sync, the system will update the part quantities correctly in the database and they will appear correctly in Web\nCentral; however, the mobile application will not show these new quantities. Also, any changes made by other mobile users or Web Central users to the\npart quantities will not be synced. The workaround is to go the Sync settings on the mobile application and click the button that says \u201cReset Background\nData Sync Flag\u201d. When you return to the Maintenance application, the background data will automatically sync, and the part quantities will be updated on\nthe device. (3053237)\nMaintenance. Seeing Rejected Requests. Approvers can reject requests back to the requestor or step completer . However, mobile users cannot see or\nresubmit those rejected requests from the mobile application. This must be done from the Building Operations Console.(3048370)\nMaintenance. Photos. You can request maintenance from the Workplace Services Portal app and the Maintenance app, and you can update maintenance\nrequests from the Maintenance app. However, the two apps store maintenance photos in different tables (wr and activity_log), which can cause problems when\nediting or deleting a photo. When you request maintenance using the Workplace Services Portal app and add a photo, and then access the corresponding work\nrequest using the Maintenance app, the photo will be shown. However, if later the photo is deleted by the Maintenance team from the work request (wr) record,\nthe photo will not be deleted from the activity_log record, and vice versa. There are several alternative scenarios for adding, changing, or deleting photos which\nmay cause this kind of issue. This issue will be fixed in a future release. (3047423)\nWorkplace Portal. Chinese. If you enter a space after a Building Code value, you will encounter an error with Rooms/ Locate Employee. (AD-5913)\nWorkplace known limitations\nDesktop. Open in App Button. On certain laptops with trackpads and without a mouse plugged in, Workplace displays the Open in App button, which should be\ndisplayed only in the Workplace mobile app. (AD-9349)\niPad Pro.\nPeople & Places.

If you are in the process of using Workplace and close the device screen, Workplace freezes and you cannot continue your\noperation upon your return. (AD-9469)\nService Catalog. Locations. When you select a location for the service request using the map and then switch to the Locations by Room Type tab, you will find\nthat the Room Types are not listed. (AD-9009).\nService Catalog. Accessibility Mode. If Accessibility Mode is enabled, the ..archibus/schema/ab-products/essential/workplace/index.html?\naction=servicecatalog URL displays the pre-V2022.02 Service Catalog view and does not display the Dashboard, as is the behavior for V2022.02 without\nAccessibility Mode. (AD-8901)\nDesk Bookings\nDepartment and Room Type filter. If you choose a Department filter first and then a Room Type filter, in that order, then the drawing will not show\navailable seats. You can remove the Department filter to see available seats. (AD-10343)\nConfirmation Check-in Message. If a booking requires that you check in, when you book the room you receive a message reminding you to check in.\nOn an iPhone running the Workplace mobile app or browser, the check-in confirmation message is truncated. (AD-9568)\nSearch for Room Type and Employee. If you search for a room based on room type and then search for a person's location, the filter should be reset to\nreflect both the room type and the employee; instead, the last selected filter (in this case, employee) clears the previous filter (in this case, Room Type).\n(AD-9465)\nMultiple Bookings for the Same Room. If you have the AllowMultipleBookings parameter set to No, you make a booking, and then select\nWorkspaces again; the recommendation shows the same room you just booked, the current date, and the option to book the room. You can go ahead and\nsuccessfully book the room a second time despite the setting of the AllowMultipleBookings parameter. (AD-9283)\nQR Codes. Attempting to book a room that was previously booked (but is now available) using the QR code results in the room not being available.\nOccupiers can use the QR code to check into their booking. Also, QR code users have trouble checking into a room. For example, if the room capacity is\ntwo or more and if there is only one booking on the room, the Check-In button is not visible to QR code users. (AD-8284)\nVisitor. When you make a workspace booking for a new Visitor, the Visitor Department is not saved. (AD-9016)\nCancel. Workspace Booking Summary Page. Select Cancel while on the Workspace Booking Summary page, and you move to the People & Places\nview, instead of the Dashboard landing page. (AD-9017)\nRooms without Room Categories. The Create and Review Bookings view may show fewer rooms available for a building than a user might expect IF\nrooms have been flagged as bookable but do not have a Room Category associated with them. Since hotelable rooms should be in occupiable space,\nand since Room Categories are required to indicate occupiable space, those users who are defining hotelable rooms will want to check that all rooms\ndefined as hotelable include a Room Category value. In a future release the Define Hotelable Rooms view might be updated to enforce that requirement.\n(AD-4915)\nBooking Multiple Seats. Floor Capacity Target. When the application is set up such that AbSpaceHotelling-AllowMultipleBookings is set to\nYes and AbSpaceHotelling-EnforceFloorCapacityTarget is set to Yes, when users encounter a room with more than 1 seat available, they have\nthe option to book multiple seats in their own name. However, users can book up to the total number of available seats in this room, even if it exceeds the\nFloor Capacity Target set for this floor. They will be able to proceed with the booking and exceed the Floor Capacity Target. The next person who tries to\nbook on the floor, however, will be prevented from making any further bookings. (AD-7498).\nMeeting Room Reservations\nMultiple Room Configurations. In Workplace, we assume that only one configuration and one room arrangement has been defined for a room. If you\ncreate multiple room configurations with the Reservations application, the configurations will appear in Workplace, but there is no distinguishing\ninformation about the configurations and the user will not know which space they are reserving. There will also appear to be a discrepancy between the\navailable room count and the number of rooms shown on the floor plan. (AD-835, APP-5194, APP-5845)\nRecurrence Pattern. Workspace reservations do not show recurrence patterns in the details view. You can only delete a single occurrence at a time. AD-\n835)\nTime Slots. Meeting space requests do not honor the value of the parameter in AbWorkplaceReservations-MinutesTimeUnit. You can only select\ntime intervals in 30-minute blocks. (AD-7010)\nWorkplace Mobile App\nWeb Browser. UI. Meeting Room Reservations. If you reserve a meeting room and proceed to the \u201cMeeting Booking: Name and Attendees\u201d page, you\nwill find that the top of the Select Employee page or Select Department pages are cut off. (AD-8598)\nMeeting Reservation. You cannot change Start Time or Duration from the selected value to note; you can change only to other available Start times or\nDurations. As a workaround, click Cancel and start over. (AD-9554)\nCalendar Icon. The calendar icon is not clickable/tappable; only the date box is clickable/tappable, which opens both the calendar dropdown and the\nkeyboard at the same time. The keyboard blocks the calendar, making the view hard to work with. (AD-9478, AD-9479)\n\nSigning in. Android. You cannot log in if not using Mobile Client 4.0. As a workaround, upgrade to Mobile Client 4.0. (AD-6801)\nIcon and Title. On iPhones and iPads, the main page listing all your apps has the wrong icon and title for the Workplace app. (AD-8653)\nHeader and Footer. On iPhone 12, the header of the application is cut so that you cannot access buttons located at the top of the screen, such as \"My\nAccount\" or \"Cancel\" buttons. (AD-7459)\nHiding the Create A Service Request Button. Setting the SelfServiceCreateRequest and KioskCreateRequest application Parameters to 0\nand scanning a QR code for a Room or Equipment should hide the \u201cCreate A Service Request\u201d button; however, the button does show. (AD-8746).\nBlank Areas. We are working on problems of extra blank areas appearing in various screens of the Workplace mobile app. (AD-8258).\nSearching. Dismiss Keyboard. If you search and then dismiss the keyboard, the screen area that the keyboard occupied remains blank.(AD-8227, AD-8006)\nCancel Button. On vertical tablets and phones, some form fields are not as high as other fields, creating an unbalanced look and resulting in the Cancel\nicon not correctly fitting. (AD-8054)\nSelect Occupants for Workspace Booking. If you try to book six or more staff for working space, the UI cannot correctly display you selected\nemployees. (AD-8599)\nWorkplace Services known limitations\nHoteling known limitations\nWorkplace Utilization Report. Highlighting the floor plan produces inconsistent results.

The following components of the Service Console do not work on the Firefox browser: Search button, column sorting, Smart Search\nfilter, folding the request tree for each status. (AD-9570)\nManage Request Types. Non-English Locale. When using the Service Desk / Service Desk Manager / Manage Request Types view (ab-create-activitytype-\ntabs.axvw) to edit request types that have been translated into other locales, the request type does not appear correctly in Service Desk Manager edit form. (AD-\n2813)\nReservations known limitations\nReservations Calendar Console. Catering and Other Resources. When you edit a reservation with catering, if you change the selected room to another room\nin the same building, an error message states that the catering is not available under the new conditions; however, the catering is, in fact, still available. The\ncatering is canceled, but you can manually add it again. Similarly, if you added limited or unique resources to the reservation and then changed the room, those\nresources are also canceled; however, the system creates them again under a new resource reservation id. (AD-9651)\nReservations Calendar Console. Multiple Room Arrangements. If you have defined multiple arrangements with different time frames for a particular room,\nthe room arrangements are available for you to choose from the drop-down list when creating a reservation. However, you will find that when reserve a room with\na particular arrangement, the times might not reflect the times assigned to the arrangement. This also occurs when making a reservation from Workplace. (AD-\n9233)\nReservations Calendar Console. Attendees in Room. Does not correctly set the \u201cAttendees in Room\u201d field value when creating meetings; there is no way for\na user to manually edit this value. (AD-4856)\nReservations Calendar Console. Double-byte Characters and Comments Field. The Calendar Console presents an error message when you attempt to\nconfirm a reservation whose comment includes double-byte characters and is larger than 4000 characters. As a workaround, enter smaller comments when a\ncomment includes double-byte characters. (AD-436)\nReservations Calendar Console. Recurring Reservations for Monthly Meetings. The timeline does not always correctly display recurring patterns for\nmonthly meetings. For example, if you created a reservation for the first Monday of the month, the Reservations Calendar Console might show all Mondays in\nthe month. Although the timeline might not display these reservations correctly, the Console does correctly save these meeting dates and the summary text\nreflects the proper date. (APP-6651)(AD-1028)\nReservations Calendar Console. Room Configurations. For situations in which multiple reservations exist at the same time in the same room, but for different\nroom configurations, the calendar displays only one reservation. (APP-6561)\nReservations Calendar Console. Continuous Meetings. The system does not prompt you resolve continuous meetings that have conflicts; when it encounters\nthis situation, the system generates a workflow rule error. (APP-6535)\nReservations Calendar Console. Conference Calls.\nIf you create a conference call and you select several buildings in order to select rooms in several buildings; and if many of the rooms in one building are\nreservable, all of the rooms for this building are shown, and reservable rooms from other buildings are not displayed. This can make hard to select rooms\nfrom different buildings. The TimelineMaxRoomsPerBuilding application parameter does not control this.(APP-6214)\nYou cannot edit the date and time of a conference call reservation. (APP-6613)\nReservations Calendar Console. Changing Room Selection.Time not Recorded. If you select a room, select a time, add some resources, and select\nanother room; you will find that the designated time does not persist to the second room. (APP-6800)\nReservations Calendar Console. Application Parameters. The TimelineStartTime and TimelineEndTime parameters work only with one-hour\nincrements. If you enter times such as 9:30 and 17:30 in the parameters, the Calendar Console does not consider them. (APP-6698)\nCreate Resource Reservation. Reservation Timeline. Microsoft Surface. You cannot drag with touch input a reservation on the timeline. Timeline drag-and-\ndrop supports only mouse events. (APP-3312)\nOutlook Plugin. My Reservations. When the Outlook Plugin displays the My Reservations, the popup is opened without the option to edit any of the\nreservations showed, so users cannot add resources. The Add Reservation button is also disabled. (AD-4846)\nGoogle Calendar Integration. When you have configured the application for \"no integration\" with Exchange, the .ics files that are generated to be imported into\nOutlook, Google Calendar, or any other calendar app, sometimes do not correctly update the Google Calendar application. Specifically, there can be a problem\nwith the file content related to the meeting identifiers created by the application. These meeting identifiers are not always unique. If you create a new calendar,\ninstead of importing an existing one, the creation of meetings seems to work correctly for single and recurring reservations, but updates and cancellations don\u2019t\nalways work as expected.\nSpace known limitations\nDefine Buildings and Floors View. Deleting buildings from the ab-ess-def-bl-fl.axvw view takes an unreasonable amount of time. (AD-8091)\nSpace Console. Deselecting a room. In the following sequence, the selected room will remain selected despite using the Clear button to deselect it:\n1)In the floor plan, click on a room to select it.\n2)Highlight by a property such as Division.\n3)Invoke the Highlight form again and choose Clear Highlight to remove the highlight.\n4)On the floor plan, click Clear to deselect the room. Notice that it remains selected.\nTo resolve this issue, invoke the highlight again and clear it; the room will become unselected. (AD-9368)\nSpace Console. Bulk editing rooms. If you select from the floor plan more than 10 rooms and attempt to bulk-edit them, the form may not display all the fields\nand buttons making it difficult or impossible to edit the selected rooms. When editing rooms in bulk, edit fewer than 10 rooms at one time. (AD-2711)\nSpace Console. Generate Ad Hoc PDF. Large Drawings. For large drawings, such as one with an SVG size of 5590K, the report may not generate. In these\ncases, increase the memory, such as increasing the Tomcat memory to 2048 M. (AD-2048)\nSpace Console. Employees tab. Selecting Employees. If you have a list of employees that runs over multiple pages, when you select employees and then\nmove to \"Next\" or \"Previous\" page, the selection will be cleared. As a workaround, you can first use the \"Place Employee in Waiting Room\" or \"Unassign\" action\nfor the selected employees on the current page, and then move to a different page to select additional employees. (AD-2741)\nSpace Console. Team Space. Organization Name field. When assigning associations to teams, you will see that the Associations tab includes the\nOrganization Name field. This is validated by the Organizational Units (org) table. To create the values for the Organizational Units table so that they are\navailable when completing the Organization Name field, you must use the Smart Client. Create a new view that holds the org table and use this view to define\nyour organizational units. (3052882)\n\nSpace Console. VPA. If a user has VPA set for division or department, the user can still update an employee's location to be a room that does not belong to the\ndivision or department VPA. This can be done by:\nUsing the Space Console to drag and drop the employee to the new room.\nUsing Define Employee or Edit Employee to update the employee's building, floor, room (note that this can only be done by directly inputting the location,\nas the select-values list of rooms will obey VPA).\nIf the user does update the employee location to a new room that does not belong to the same division or department as is set by VPA, the location change will\nnot create a workspace transaction, and therefore the employee's change will not be recorded in history.\nSpace Console. Plan Types. Using Plan Types on the Space Console affords the user the ability to personalize highlights, text labels, and printed legends to\nthe deployment's needs, in addition to the pre-existing highlights and label options that exist on the Space Console's drop-down menus. The Add-In Manager\ndefines Plan Type highlights and labels by creating or modifying view files and datasources that are logged in the active_plantypes table. However, to make\nchanges or add legend datasources, in addition to defining those datasources in the view file that active_plantypes references, the Add-In manager must:\n1. Make an associated change in the same view file for a highlight datasource, and name it as the legend is named. For example, if the Add-In Manager\nmakes a legend datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend\", they must also make an associated highlight datasource named \"ds_ab-sp-\nhl-rm-by-dp-name_rmHighlight\".\n2. In the PDF export AXVW file ab-sp-console-export-drawing-pdf.axvw, the Add-in Manager must also create a legend-type panel and refer to the\nnew legend datasource. Following the same example, the panel's id must be named panel_ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend, and the\ndatasource must equal ds_ab-sp-hl-rm-by-dp-name_rmLegend. The fields that the datasource defines and that should be visible in the legend must\nbe defined in that panel. (3050005)\nSpace Requests. Moves. If you change the From Location in a space request, use Space / Moves / Move Coordinator / Complete Group Moves to close the\nmove, and check the rmpct record, you will see that the value for primary_em is still 0. It should change to 1 since user has changed the From Location from\nsatellite location to primary location. The conditions for this situation are: workspace transactions are enabled, the SLA for Group Move calls for the service\nprovider as Move Management and no approvers, and the application parameters are: InferRoomDepartments=0 and\nAssignUnallocatedSpace=ProrateFloor. (3043629)\nMoves. Action Questionnaires. If you add new Action Types (using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Types task), you cannot add\nquestionnaires to these new action types using the Space / Moves / Background Data / Define Action Questionnaires task. (3028382)\nMaintenance known limitations\nChinese Locale. Tagging in Comments. When you tag someone in a comment using OnSite or WebCentral, the system generates an email; under a Chinese\nlocale, the strings in both email title and email body are not translated. Non-translated text includes: the string 'tagged you in work request' in both email title and\nemail body, as well as all the strings for work request parameters in email body. (AD-9394)\nTime Zones. You will encounter the wrong time zone in work orders (11:57 AM instead of 1:57 PM) if you select the \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value as the time zone using\nthe Define Geographical Locations view. Instead, select a city-specific time zone such as \"Europe/Paris timezone(UTC+1)\". The \u201cEtc/GMT+1\u201d value will be\nremoved in the future as it is not necessary. (AD-8802)\nLabor Scheduler: Some work requests are not shown when multiple are assigned to single craftsperson in single day. (AD-8076)\nMaintenance Console. Report Problem Button. If the restrictLoadingOfUnassignedViews property is set to true in \\web-inf\\config\\security.properties, a\nuser with access to the Maintenance Console can be prevented from using the Report Problem button. This is a result of the Report Problem button calling a\nsecond view that is not listed in a process that is assigned to the user's role. To resolve this issue, add ab-bldgops-console-wr-create.axvw to the afm_ptasks\nprocess assigned to this user role. (AD-8377)\nMaintenance Console. Email Notifications. Attached Documents. If in the Manage Service Desk Steps task, you select the Work Request Issued notification\nstep and attach documents, you will find that for work requests using this SLA step, attachments are not included in the email notification. (AD-7758)\nMaintenance Console. Equipment Documents. Only the Add, Update, and Delete actions for working with documents should be controlled by the user role.\nCurrently, actions such as Show and Download are incorrectly controlled by user role.(AD-8299)\nCraftsperson Sample Data. In the sample HQ project, there are many records in Craftspersons (cf) table that do not have email account; also many have\nduplicated email accounts like no-response@archibustgd.com. The key convention for the workflow is: cf.email=em.email=afm_users.email. These\nvalues must be unique. To fix this issue, just remove those records from the cf table for which emails are either empty or have duplicated value. Below are some\nsituations where duplicated values can cause problems\nLaunch SLA console, dispatch to supervisor, click Select Value, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_supervisor=1\nContinue to add a estimation step, select employee to do estimation, you will see all employees instead of all cf.is_estimator=1\nLaunch the Maintenance Console, click any work request, click the Forward button, select supervisor, you will see all employees instead of all meeting the\nrestriction: cf.is_supervisor=1.(AD-6744)\nCraftspersons. Notifications.For SLAs that are configured so craftspersons are to be notified when work is issued (notify craftsperson check-box), the\ncraftsperson is not receiving notification when the work is issued. (AD-4960)\nAssets known limitations\nEquipment Systems Console: If auto-lookup is enabled, selecting the View Full Equipment Profile icon in the Equipment detail panel produces an error. (AD-\n8345)\nAsset Disposal Console. Changing Building Status from Asset Disposal Console Causes Inconsistencies in REPM. The Asset Disposal Console updates\nthe asset records for Buildings and Properties as well as inserts OT records to match when the asset is disposed of. REPM reports on Owned, Pipeline, and\nDisposed OT statuses for buildings, but ignores buildings with other ownership transaction statuses, or gives unexpected results in reports. The REPM Building\nAdd/Edit Wizard does not have a way to modify the status of the bl record. Setting the transaction Status to Owner does not change the status of the building to\nOwned. Coordinate OT records with asset status in both REPM and Disposal Console. (APP-852)\nDefine Classifications. Deleting Top Levels. In the Define Classification view (ab-ca-def-class.axvw, which is available from the Business Process\nOwner process of Asset Management, Condition Assessment, and Environmental Sustainability Assessment), you cannot delete a top level. Instead, you must\ndelete the top level by using Smart Client and deleting the record from the csi table. If you are not going to use a top-level classification hierarchy, it is advisable\nto delete all the child records (under the top level) before deleting the top level. (AD-6682)\nClassifications. Localization. Numeric ID (Automatic Lookup). The Classifications (csi) and Classification Standards (csi_std) tables are not translatable.\nTherefore, in order to use the Automatic Lookups (Numeric IDs) feature for asset classifications, enable Automatic Lookups for them without\nafm_scmpref.preferences. Otherwise, Archibus will look for the translatable fields in the two tables, resulting in application errors. Also, the Asset\nClassification Description field (csi.description) and the field Classification Standard Description (csi_std.description) are not translatable. If enabling\nthe Automatic Lookup for these fields, do not use the attribute displayType=\"translate\" because the fields are not translatable.(APP-4286) (AD-6683).\nEnterprise Assets known limitations\nProject Proposal Console. Baseline cost of a Billion Monetary Units or Greater. If you enter a baseline cost for an individual required asset that is a billion\nmonetary units or greater, you get an error that the value entered exceeds the maximum storage unit for the field. This is because the value for the baseline cost\nin the sb_items table is defined as numeric (9,1). However, the value you entered displays correctly in the grid and in the statistical summary because the value\nin the eq_req_items table is defined as numeric (16,2). This error occurs only in the rare case that the cost of an individual asset is a billion monetary units or\ngreater. (3052851)\nProject Proposal Console. Selected Period Fields not Displaying. The default selection is to display Baseline and Period 1. If you add other period fields but\nthen want to return to the default setting and find that the Console is not displaying your selection, clear your browser cache. (APP-1601)\nManage Reference Documents. This task enables you to associate a document with a Building Use, Property Type, and Furniture Standard. However, there is\ncurrently no way to view documents added for these items. It also enables you to associate a document with projects of different types. Currently, you are able to\nview documents for only projects that have the Scenario type. You are, however, able to view documents added for work request Problem Types, PM\nprocedures, and action items that are associated with a Proposed project. (3050281)\nAsset Portal known limitations\nView Equipment Plan. If you have a lot of asset symbols on the floor plan, they may not display the Equipment Code as asset text and may not be correctly\nfilled with color. (3028852)\n\nReal Property known limitations\nPortfolio known limitations\nGlobal Portfolio Dashboard. Oracle. Chinese. When running this view with a Chinese local and Oracle database, the KPI session is missing from the upper\nleft corner. (AD-9403)\nForecasting known limitations\nPortfolio Forecasting Wizard. Calculations. If the user units are different from the project units, when you calculate the area on the floor for an allocation event\nby multiplying headcount by average area per employee, the result can be off by a factor of 10.76. (3052105)\nStrategic Financial Analysis known limitations\nFinancial Analysis Console. VPA. The console does not load if the user has a VPA that is not compatible with the console restriction. Please see Adding VPA to\nthe Financial Analysis Console \u00a0for details on creating a VPA for this console. (3053673)\nSustainability &\u00a0Risk known limitations\nCompliance known limitations\nExtended Questionnaires. Service Requests from Mobile. Although the ability to create service requests from questionnaires was added to the Compliance\nSurveys mobile app, it has not yet been implemented in the Web Central Compliance application. Therefore, if a mobile questionnaire respondent provides\ndetails for a follow-up Service Request actions for any question in a questionnaire, then the respondent should take care to fully submit the questionnaire via the\nmobile app; they should not edit or submit via the Web Central questionnaire edit form because the Web Central edit form might not preserve the request details\nor set the status of the request as expected via the mobile app. (APP-4250)\nExtended Questionnaires. Assigned to Events. View my Events Calendar. The \"View My Events Calendar\" task for Compliance Program Coordinators does\nnot provide a link from events details to answer or review any questionnaires that might be attached to assigned events. The workaround is for Program\nCoordinators to use one of the other \"My... Events\" tasks to access assigned questionnaires.(APP-1667)\nExtended Questionnaires. Question Tree.
